MonoFe is supposed to be and arcade frontend that can run on Windows, Linux and MacOs. It's written in C# Mono using GTK# for GUI.

The project has just started so everything can change :-)

To run MonoFe you should install MooDevelop, .NET Framework 4.0 and GTK# for .NET 2.12.10. Everything you need is here : http://monodevelop.com/Download

Then download the source code from here : https://github.com/gotleg/MonoFe

When it's done you can open the sln file and run the project in MonoDevelop.

Enjoy :-)
