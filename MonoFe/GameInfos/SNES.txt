7th Saga Redux
Platform: Super NES
Region: Update Hacks
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 2008
Players: 1
Original Title: The 7th Saga
Hacked By: Nati
Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
7th Saga was a challenging and original RPG for SNES, but suffered from ridiculous difficulty and tedious level grinding. This hack attempts to address the difficulty so that the game is challenging without being frustrating, and to add a few fun elements to expand the strategy. Equipment and attack spells have been powered-up. Some enemies have been given elemental weaknesses, and a new spell has been introduced.

A Halloween Walk!
Platform: Super NES
Region: Update Hacks
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Original Title: Super Mario World
Hacked By: MATTAN
_________________________
*
First thing I noticed is the changed overworld (as you can see in the pictures) and I'm always glad if someone makes the effort to do that. Moreover the whole game is in a halloween style and I think the creator used a lot available options to make it look scary (if you can call a smw hack scary). Also the music is fitting to the theme.

The level of difficulty is not very high so it's also a beginner-friendly hack (but it's not too easy if you think that).

And the highlight is the last (secret) level where you have to fight a (WARNING: SPOILER!!!) giant radioactive four-eyed boo (with this amazing music), which is just awesome.

All in all I give it 9 of 10 possible points.

A.S.P.: Air Strike Patrol
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Shooter , Isometric
_________________________
*
Playing as a jet pilot of the "Coalition" force, players take control of either an F-15 Eagle, or an A-10 Tankbuster jet. The mission is to neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring country. The Zarak army has many ground units, including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD missiles and armored vehicles.

To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the Zarak army, players venture out on numerous missions (called "sorties") that have varied and specific objectives. Typically, various installations such as radar sites, air bases or ground units are the target. Other missions include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying SCUD launchers before they fire.

Pre-mission screens ask the player to select from the two planes. Then, the player can specify the armament to carry into the sortie. Air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles are available for each of the planes. Here, a strategic choice between countering either air units or ground units has to be made, as each area (of which there are eight) is patrolled by opposing enemy F-15 jets.

The game is played through the isometric-perspective, and the plane's speed and direction can be be adjusted in real-time. Altitude however, is fixed. A missile/bomb-target is constantly shown on the ground before the plane, allowing players to aim at units, or, with the F-15, a lock-on targeting system is available.

The game also makes use of a briefing before each mission, and also a further briefing by an animated colonel on the tarmac just before take-off. Various debriefing screens are shown also, and, if the player attains a certain strike rate, a "GNN" news story may play out. For each mission, a time-limit and minimum destruction-rate must be met. You can take-off as often as need be to attain this.

Tips:

Extra Missiles and Fuel
Pause the game with controller 1 and then enter the following code on controller 2: A-B-A-B-Select- A. Then you should get more missiles and fuel.

Powerful A10 Tank Buster
First choose the A-10 as your plane. Wait for the Good Luck message to disappear from the screen, shoot your
30mm cannon one time, then hold down the X button. Keep it held down and the message, 'Super A-10' will appear on the screen to confirm that the cheat worked. Now your weapon will be much more powerful.

Accele Brid
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Shooter , Third Person , Tube Shooter
Release Year: 2002
Original Title: Accele Brid
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.00
_________________________
*
Accelebrid is one of those games with giant robots. You know, the ones that can fly and have an arsenal comparable to the Death Star. Anyway, you play as the pilot of the Silver Mare, a giant robot armor thingie that can be armed with any two of six weapons which he must use to kill terrorists that kidnapped his woman. The graphics are interesting, to say the least, as it seems to be the SNES's attempt at a quasi-3D engine. Basically, you're hurtling through a red and white corridor thing against a blue-toned background. It almost looks like someone barfed a candy cane onto your telivision while watching Jacques Coustou in a room with a strobe light. As far as shooters go, the gameplay is kinda ho-hum. It functions in that it throws stuff at you which you must destroy or dodge, so I guess it does what a shooter is supposed to at the basest levels. However, the game is nothing to write home about.

Translation Description:

Well, Gideon has done well in that everything is translated. However, this isn't really a text-heavy game, so it's no surprise that it was finished in a month. This game was basically just a traingin exercise for Super Robot Wars 3, anyhow.

Actraiser
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game , Side-Scrolling , Strategy
Release Year: 2006
Players: 1
Original Title: Actraiser
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.00
_________________________
*
Developers trying to make their games fresh and new by slapping something "innovative" onto a successful formula is nothing new. It's also nothing exclusive to video games. It is, however, a rare thing in any medium to discover that such an act was done right.

Actraiser is one of those rare games. The game starts with an interesting concept. You are a god. Literally. You even have your very own little cherub buddy to help you out. The world is very much your oyster. Then you're thrown into a sidescrolling action game. okay, that's kind of cool. hacking and slashing is fun, and the backgrounds, enemies, and bosses are pretty slick-looking. And then the gameplay completely changes into a relatively simple simulation-type game, with you in total control.

Actraiser takes these two very different game types and seamlessly melds them into a work of pure gaming bliss. The world is divided up into different regions. The first time you go to a region, you enter a side-scrolling platformer stage. If you make it through and defeat the boss, you gain access to the overhead sim part of the region. During this portion of the game you guide villagers in the construction of the town. You have to destroy terrain that inhibits expansion, and appease your worshipers. And you have to guide your cherub buddy in keeping the monsters at bay until the villagers can seal the portals they're coming out of. keep the villagers happy and they give you gifts, which range from power-ups to items to use in other villages. Once you've sealed all the monster portals the final dungeon for the region is revealed-another sidescroller. Beat that stage and you've cleared the region.

You can play the regions in any order, but you'll likely have to keep revisiting previous regions as you progress to use some item that you just received to solve a lingering problem in another village. It's this kind of interaction that really brings the game together-it really feels like you're getting to know the people who are worshipping you.

The other point to the simulation part is to level up the avatar you go spelunking through dungeons with. As the total population of the world increases, so too do your levels. Increased levels in turn give you more spell charges and higher maximum health, which make the sidescrolling stages easier.

Actraiser is a brilliant combination of two different, yet popular genres. Each portion of the game feels natural, and blatantly effects the other-everything you do matters. Nothing feels gimmicky or tacked-on. It's sad that it saw just one sequel, and that nobody has seen fit to try and create something like it since.

Translation Description:

Shame on you if you've never played Actraiser before! This version, other than having an amazingly badass logo, is actually a lot harder than the US release of the game. Even in Fillmore 1, there are more brambles, more monsters, more everything. It's crazy great. Ian Kelley wanted to retranslate the game, so here it is! Far be it from me to deprive one of my star translators from an awesome request or two!

If you've never played it, now's your chance. The translation is complete and, to my knowledge, bug-free. Enjoy!

ActRaiser 2
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA

Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Quintet
Publisher: Enix
Players: 1
_________________________

The position of ActRaiser 2 in the series timeline is not explicitly revealed, however many plot details suggest that ActRaiser 2 may actually be a prequel to the original ActRaiser, or take place in another universe entirely.

Unlike the original game which alternately combined platform game sequences and god game sequences, ActRaiser 2 is only a platform game.

The game begins with the universe over-run with evil, with The Master battling with Tanzra. Tanzra, once The Master's servant, led a rebellion against The Master, but lost and was banished from Heaven.

Ripped and torn, the slain body of Tanzra fell to the underworld. Feeding on the intense hatred each held for The Master, Tanzra's seven deadly sins and their minions combined their power to raise the spirit of their mighty leader. Tanzra, now vowing revenge for his defeat by The Master, unleashed these demons upon the world. The player in this game assumes the role of The Master, aided by an angel associate known as Crystalis.

Some of the stages in the game are meant to be ironic regarding the blighting nature of Tanzra's demons. The townsmen in the city of Leon are sent to the underground prison of Gratis for not paying their taxes by a newly appointed king named Kolunikus who is afflicted by Greed. The final staged level of the game pits the player against a mechanically engineered god in the city of Humbleton, a battle of Pride (a satire on the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel).

After the player slays the first six deadly sins, the Tower of Babel appears in which you fight the final sin, Pride. You then descend into Hell where you again fight the seven sins as well as Tanzra himself, a beast frozen waist-deep in a lake of ice (just as Satan was in the Inferno in The Divine Comedy).

During the game's credits it is declared that "The Master will live forever", followed by an image of the statue of The Master slowly eroding over time. The statue's sword and right wing fall off, suggesting the growth of civilization and the increase of mankind's self-sufficiency. This reflects the ending of the original ActRaiser, where the servant speculates that someday the world may be so independent that it will forget about the Master.

The New Arrival Has Disappeared!

Evil nanny, Debbie Jellinsky, has stolen Baby Pubert and only you, Uncle Fester, can save him in an outrageous role-playing adventure--Addams Family style!

Venture through maze-filled gardens and goon-infested swamps. Gather clues and use your Addams charm to con Debbie's "loyal" friends into helping you--for a price!

And maybe with a little Family advice and lots of Addams cunning, you'll be able to rescue Pubert and put your evil bride Debbie... in the hot seat!

--from the back cover of Addams Family Values for SNES

Addams Family Values is challenging but rarely frustrating, once you become adept at fighting and evading it gets easier, and there are no "cheap shots". In my experience, wandering around the expansive regions was enjoyable because I wasn't in constant danger of getting killed, there was so much to look for and find, and the graphics and music kept me amused. 

Directions:

Help Fester, Gomez, Morticia, Granny, Wednesday, Pugsly, Thing, Lurch & Cousin It find baby Pubert and stop the evil Debby Jelinsky. 

Trivia:

On the original VHS release of Addams Family Values, a promo for the video game is seen, with a rebate coupon offer. The music playing during this promo is an altered version of the theme song to the 1987 edition of the game show Blockbusters.

Hints:

Start with full skull energy, all weapons and most items.

Platform: Super NES

Genre: Adventure , Platformer
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Ocean Software
Publisher: Ocean Software
_________________________

Okay, so I recently started playing this game again after I re-discovered Mighty Max on YouTube. The game's concept revolves around the player's character collecting pieces to some dooms day machine. Now, I first played this game when it first came out, and I played the game on a frequent basis until I realized it was too hard! The game doesn't really tell you how to collect the items, so your forced to walk around until you discover random tools and gadgets that help you. This is especially frustrated since the game was marketed towards to little kids, who may grow impatient at the game's slow pace and infinitely re-spawning enemies.

Despite the game's sub par gameplay, the music and graphics are not that bad, considering the came out in 1995. The music at the main screen is fairly catch, but the game's sound effects are one-dimensional. Probably, the best feature of the game is its two-player mode, allowing you and your buddy to team-up and fight Skull Master's minions. This game isn't really a must have, unless you're a die-hard Mighty Max fan. All in all, the game will keep you busy for awhile, given you don't set fire to it out of frustration. The game has potential, but the aforementioned follies keep it from being a killer.

Grab your pic-a-nic basket and jump into this zany platform adventure through Jellystone Park. When Yogi catches wind that they are going to turn the park into a power plant, he must run out to stop them. Fight your way through Jellystone park, to get to the Ranger and tell him what they are planning.

Yogi Bear is a great platforming adventure with graphics that are, to say the least, excellent, right down to the background scenes and the funny looking animal enemies. The music in this game is good and keeps with the theme of the game. All in all this fun game is worth playing, so enjoy yourself!

Directions:

The Adventures of Yogi Bear is a game of jumping around, collecting items, and stomping enemies. Play through five Park areas (10 levels) and collect picnic baskets and stop-watches to collect points.

Jump on other park animals such as skunks, birds, rabbits, and the occasional snow-man, that are trying to stop you.

Make sure you keep an eye on the cake in the lower right hand of the screen, because it's your health meter. When you get hit, you lose a piece of cake. When the cake is gone you die, and you only have 4 lives. After clearing each level you move on to the next. Sorry, all you rabid killer bears out there, there are no bosses to tangle with. So get to jumping, and help Jellystone keep its lovely pristine habitat. Good Luck!

There are 8 stages in this game. The beginning stages consists of randomly chosen areas from nations of unselected fighters (assuming those fighters have nations). If Rabio or Lepus is chosen, all 4 rival nation stages become playable. After completing all rival nation stages, there are 4 more stages.

In SNES version, the are 2 stage loops, and the order of rival nations is fixed. In 2nd loop, the game's difficulty increased, except in VERY HARD difficulty, where 2nd loop is easier.

Player and team-specific endings occur after completing 1st loop. After completing 2nd loop, ending consists of all pilot pairs giving a speech, with 2nd pilot in the last pair giving cheat code.

The SNES version adds hidden boss attack and time attack modes, Rabio and Lepus fighters (from Rabio Lepus, known outside of Japan as Rabbit Punch).

Aero the Acro-Bat
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Iguana Entertainment
Publisher: Sunsoft
Players: 1
_________________________
*
Inspired in part by the "mascots with attitude" trend that was common following the introduction of Sonic the Hedgehog. it featured a red bat named Aero, who works and lives in a circus. He must defend the circus from an evil ex-clown called Edgar Ektor, who used to work in the same circus and wants it shut down forever. Aero must also deal with the sidekick Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel.

The levels are played in typical 2D platforming, but in order to clear levels, the player must accomplish certain tasks so that the exit warp can be revealed. Those tasks include passing through hoops, step on platforms until they disappear, ride roller coasters, etc. There are 4 worlds with 5 levels in each one, and the levels are large, many of them containing awkwardly positioned spikes that kill instantly.

Aero can attack enemies by shooting limited stars or by doing an aerial diagonal drill attack at his target (when he is in the air).

During the 16-bit era, Aero had a fair share of fame. Sunsoft used him as a mascot during the 16-bit console days. After the 16-bit decline, he disappeared and was forgotten until 2002, when Metro 3D decided to port this game for the Game Boy Advance, with a battery back-up (which the original versions lacked).

Aero the Acro-Bat was awarded Best New Character of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

Aero the Acro-Bat 2 for SNES is very similar to the same game for Genesis but not exactly the same. The sound and look are a bit different, but most notably the controls are different. The look of the game is improved ever so slightly. It's a bit brighter and a bit more detailed with more rich textures. The sound effects change enough that they are more noticeable, and they sound a bit weaker and washed out in this SNES version. Good news is that the animation is still smooth and the game is still loads of fun to play, if different.

If you haven't played any of the Aero games... well, why are you starting with the second one? You know they have the first one here, right? Really... Start with the first one on Genesis to kind of get a feel for how to play. That one is a more simplified version of this game. The colors are still rich and it is loads of fun to play. Then you can work your way into this game whenever you feel like it (if you don't want to play the SNES version of the first one and the Genesis version of this one first). Complex, I know, but many games were released this way. Each game is different in its own way and offers its own special kind of fun.

Directions:

If you jump by pressing B you can spin by pressing B again in midair (you will spin diagonally in whatever direction you press on the joystick, even up!) and you can throw stars by pressing Y. This version makes throwing stars a bit easier since, unlike the Genesis version, you don't have to be standing still to throw them.

You must pick up stars before you will be able to throw them.

If you press R while you are moving you will slide in that direction. Press X and you'll go into "look" mode and be able to look around the screen by pressing on the joystick. This can be very useful for finding all of your items, since some will be in places you won't be able to see by just standing there normally. Pressing down on the directional pad or joystick will make Aero squat.

Pick up food like pizza slices, hamburgers, and candy canes for points. Also you will be rated on this at the end of the act. You will also be rated on the amount of magic stars you found and enemies that you killed.

Pick up the letters of Aero's name to be able to face Ektor on a screen where he'll slide cups around randomly and you'll have to pick the one with the extra man (or 1000 points if you prefer) under it.

Pick up capital letter A's on discs for life. These will be displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. Every time Aero is hit by something like an enemy or sharp spikes, he'll take damage and lose an A. If Aero doesn't have any A's and takes damage you'll lose a life. You start each Act with 3 of these and can carry a max of 5. If you find a big floating box with an A on it, you can spin into it and it will release A's. It will do this forever. You can rack up some extra points with these since every A you don't need (meaning over 5) will be worth 100 points. Rack up enough points and you'll get an extra man. You'll hear Aero say, "Wow!" whenever you gain an extra man.

You will find other things to help, or hinder, you along your way. Find what looks like a red and yellow party hat laying on the ground and, when you walk over it, it will unfold into a pole. This marks the halfway/restart point of the act. If you die you'll be started back here instead of at the beginning of the act. Bells will have a chain with a ring hanging from them. Jump on to these and then press back and forth with the right rhythm to get the most swing out of the chain. Swing the highest you can and you'll ring the bell and get 100 points. Beds will help you reach high places. Jump onto a bed and then let Aero bounce and bounce without pressing anything. He'll get higher and higher. In the pipe sections, if you see a stopper on a bit of pipe sticking upwards that you can jump onto, do it. It'll blast you way up where you're sure to find some goodies! Watch out for nails sticking up out of the floor. If you land on these you'll lose some health. 

Also watch out for small sharp gears that'll hurt you as well. You'll find many other helpful (or hurtful) devices like these throughout the game.

Find a curtained door with the word Chance over it and you will be transported to a special area where you will be able to pick up a ton of food and finish it off with an extra man!

Fight the evil clown menace, and whatever other weird enemies will be there, by spinning into them or throwing stars at them, and get through the act to a curtained door like the one you came in on. Now you'll be shown how you did that act. Make it through a few acts and eventually you'll come to a boss. Bosses are tougher and meaner. They will hit harder and be harder to kill than the other enemies you have dealt with previously. 

Controls:

B Button - Jump/Spin
Y Button - Throw Stars
R Button - Slide
Start Button - Pause Game
X Button - Look

Hints:

Some Walls Won't Bar You
Try Walking through walls. Many walls can be walked through and you'll finds loads of great stuff behind them!

Aerobiz
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Strategy
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Koei
Publisher: Koei
_________________________
*
Aerobiz features two timeframes to play the game through: 1963 to 1995, and 1983 to 2015. After selecting the timeframe, the players then choose a city for their airline's headquarters. This allows a certain amount of handicapping: some cities, such as New York, London, and Tokyo, start the player with many airplanes and a large amount of money; others, such as Lima, Nairobi, and Honolulu, start the player with only a couple of airplanes and a small amount of money. The players then select a difficulty level, which affects the amount of passengers, world events (and the reactions of the passengers to those world events), and the win conditions.

The gameplay is superficially straightforward: players negotiate for access slots at each airport, buy airplanes, then open routes and start business.

The routes command allows the player to open new routes (up to 30), change existing routes, or close unprofitable/redundant routes.

The negotiation command allows the player to assign representatives to bid for access slots into each airport or give back unneeded slots.

The trade command allows the player to buy and sell airplanes.

The budget command allows the player to set the maintenance, service, and advertising budgets.

The marketing command allows the player to run special ad campaigns in order to boost traffic.

The investment command allows the player to set up airport hubs to create new routes, build hotels to attract passengers, and buy and sell stock in charter companies.

The board meeting command gives the player some hints on possible moves to make in order to increase business.

Information on the cities, distances between two cities and any air routes flying between them, and data on the player's company is also available.

After each player has made their desired moves, the game shows any world events that affect the players (for instance, a labor strike will delay shipments of aircraft from that company, while the Olympic Games will boost traffic worldwide, particularly to the host city). The game then shows the results of direct competition between airlines flying the same routes, then the quarterly results of sales, expenses, profits, and passengers flown. After the January-March quarter of every year, it also shows annual results.

The game is won by the first player to achieve the win conditions: link all 22 cities and carry a certain number of passengers (between 2.5 million and 4.5 million, based on difficulty level), all while remaining profitable. If a player goes for four quarters with a negative balance, the company is declared bankrupt and offered reorganization. If the game goes for 32 years (128 turns) without any player meeting the win conditions, the game is called a loss.

Tips:

Sound Test
At the New Game / Continue screen, press Select. Then you should go to the sound test mode. Press Up or down
to scroll, A to play the song and B to return to the game.

Aim for the Ace!
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Tennis
Release Year: 2004
Original Title: Ace wo Nerae!
Version: 1.2
_________________________
*
Aim for the Ace uses the DSP chip to very good potential, but is sadly not emulated very well by any emulator. It's got this weird chase-camera thing going on where the camera is always following behind you, so the court is always moving around and crazy stuff. It seems like it'd be pretty cool, but it really doesn't work at all on emulators. The multiplayer modes don't have this problem though, cause they're all overhead.

Anyways. You're some girlie, who loooves tennis. This coach guy sees your inner talent, and works with you to have your true power shine through, and play like a true pro. I got all this information online, cause I couldn't beat the first stage, cause of the weird emulation. I keep swinging about two seconds before the ball actually gets to me. Haha!

Ace wo Nerae seems to be an old anime/manga series back in the 70s. Why they make a Super Famicom game about it I don't know, but it's pretty cool. It looks really sharp, and the sound effects are just about dead-on. It's like you're REALLY THERE!

Translation Description:

This patch absolutely requires a non-interleaved ROM with a header. If you have an interleaved ROM, you will have to find a different one. That is, you'll have to dump your original ROM differently! Of course.

There's not much to say about the translation, and in this case, no news is good news. The game's complete, and looks very nice. Version 1.2 has some various dialogue fixes and stuff.

This game is a flight sim during a war in three different places. In single player, you are one helicopter that takes on an army of tanks using missiles and machine guns. The tanks never move and just sit there and shoot you. In two player mode, You can take on an army of tanks together, or you can fight each other (While surprisingly, taking on an army of tanks at the same time). These helicopters can move anywhere on the map and adjust their height to avoid gunfire. The missions were all repetitive and very hard. Destroying an army of tanks is very hard. It's fun to fight each other on two player versus, but other than that, the gameplay is boring. You rarely get an adrenaline rush from playing this game.

Alcahest
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge

Genre: Role Playing Game , Top Down , Fantasy
Release Year: 2002
Players: 1
Original Title: Alcahest
Translated By: F.H.
Version: 1.0 Beta
_________________________
*
Alcahest! This game is? different. It's sort of an action/rpg, it's sort of an arcade game. You play as this guy Alen who runs around slashing things with his sword and collecting other swords and stuff. You can collect power-ups that expire after a fairly short amount of time, and you can do a charge attack, all in standard arcade fashion. What makes Alcahest different from most arcade games is that it's not nearly as maddeningly difficult as, say, Mars Matrix. You also get continues. Yeah, that's right, you have -limited bloody continues- to beat the game with. But that's okay, you can earn more, and the fewer you have the easier it is to gain more. You don't really get experience or anything, your "EXP" is really just credits towards your next continue, and you lose all your "EXP" if you game-over.

The storyline is? fairly cliche. It's not necessarily -bad- per se, but it's very much standard fare. Demon-thing made of hate, hero-guy collects elemental weapons and companions and kicks ass, lots of manipulation of greedy bastards by the hate-demon-thing. No earth-shattering plot twists or anything, which the game sorta needs, but eh, whatever. It's an action game. The characters are sufficiently cool, but by the time you get to the final level you'll be using the guy with the homing shots exclusively for everything but boss battles, and the healer chick for boss battles. Everyone else is just sorta chump change in comparison, even for the cool dragon chick :(

Neat trick, by the way - when you beat the game (it's not that long; five hours most I'd say) let it sit on the "END" screen for a while. Alen will show up and start showing off some of his more puny moves, and the game will cycle through every single music track for your listening or SPC-ripping enjoyment. Joy!

So yeah. I had fun with it, but I'm not sure if I'd want to play it again. It was cool while it lasted, but my attack-charging thumb is goddamn sore after that final boss*%(!

Translation Description:

Translation's as good as the readme says it is! There were one or two lines which made me do a double-take and go "huh?" and there were a few of the pixel-erase bugs and stage name bugs that the readme claimed and stuff. There was one bug I didn't see mentioned in the readme, and that's that during the ending, a guy (no names, no spoilers) is riding off on a horse, and he goes offscreen, and then the ground continues to scroll and it just? ends. Probably simply a text speed issue or somesuch, nothing huge ^_^ Overall, the patch is quite solid and quite complete. Have fun!

Urgent Communique

F161-C-WYCORP-NTCMCN-01500

...Urgent...Code Red Alert...Multiple Xenomorph Presence Confirmed on Fiorina 161...Several Prisoners Confirmed Dead...Nesting Activities Suspected Near Disabled Central Power Generators...Prime Directive: Do Not Destroy Xenomorphs...Prisoners Are Expendable...Repeat: Do Not Destroy Xenomorphs...Prisoners Are Expendable...Rescue Ship Dispatched...ETA: 12 Hours...Weyland-Yutani Network

COMCON 01500 OUT...ENDMSG

The Alien Horror Lives...And Thrives!

You are Ripley, a C-3 Grade Lieutenant for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. After barely surviving an encounter with the alien xenomorph life forms, you were returning to earth in hypersleep aboard your ship, the Sulaco. The Sulaco malfunctioned, jettisoning the emergency escape vehicle with the crew's cryotubes towards Fiorina "Fury" 161, a nearly abandoned maximum security work prison deep in space. You awoke to find yourself stranded on the isolated planet, the only survivor of the crash.

The only Human survivor, that is.

Because the Aliens you thought you'd left behind, the living nightmares you'd hoped, you'd prayed, you'd never see again, are with you. And the horror you thought was over is beginning anew.

Somewhere in Fury 161, a Queen Alien is spawning dozens, if not hundreds, of offspring that feed on flesh. The alien egg pods are everywhere, but that's only the start of your problems. The aliens multiply by invading human bodies and growing inside them, and they've kidnapped the entire population of Fury 161!

You've lived through this once before. Somehow, you survived. Now, you must face the Aliens again, and stop them once and for all!

Armed with your weapons and your wits, you are on a mission of survival. Your objectives are clear: free the prisoners that have been trapped in alien cocoons, eliminate the alien offspring that are infesting fury 161, and destroy the Queen nesting deep within the prison. If this weren't enough, all of this must be completed before the Weyland-Yutani ship arrives and gives the xenomorphs an opportunity to escape and infest other worlds.

You are engaged in the most frightening life or death struggle imaginable, and the odds are stacked against you.

--From the SNES Alien 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

Alien 3 was definitely a fun game. It had an already mega-popular story because of the huge success of the Alien movies. The graphics were awesome, with great attention to shading.

The game wasn't always just shoot the enemies, sometimes you had to repair some computer equipment or weld doors shut. This added to the realism of the game, and this was the first time I had seen anything like that in a video game. It makes you feel like you really are Ripley, and you have to survive this nightmare. Survive by not just mindless violence, but by using your head, and skills.

When it comes to firepower, this game had it all, from machine guns to flame throwers. The sounds effects sounded just like the movie, giving it that same scary movie feel. An action packed thrill ride stuffed to the brim with malevolent aliens trying to lay their eggs in your stomach. 

Directions:

Alien 3, here's where it starts to get really good. All of your time is spent in the penal colony, running around in tunnels, getting supplies from the infirmary, blowing the heck out of aliens, saving prisoners, and welding doors shut to keep the aliens contained. When welding a door or fixing electronics, be sure the area is clear of enemies, so you will have enough time to finish the task. If you get hit before your timer runs out, you will have to start your task all over again.

Controls:

A Button - Machine Gun
B Button - Jump
X Button - Grenade Launcher
Y Button - Flame Thrower
L Button - Scroll through your ammo

Now you can bring the excitement and intensity of the TV show straight to your living room with AMERICAN GLADIATORS.

--from game info on Rotten Tomatoes.com

Tips:

Easy Win
At the beginning of the Joust game, step forward two spaces, hold B and press back. You should see your
character start spinning their jousting stick over their head. Do not let go of the B button while doing this. If done correctly, the gladiator will not block and you'll be able to hit him repeatedly and easily win.

This game is out of the ordinary because movement is forwards, backwards, and side to side a movement style usually reserved for Beat 'em ups, in most side scrolling platform games the player can only go forward and backward. Pinky and the Brain once again have another plan to conquer the world by deciding to steal the script of the Greatest Movie ever while it was under development (this is not any actual movie or parody of one). The CEO of Warner Brothers studio reluctantly asks the Warner Brothers and Sister for their assistance to retrieve all 24 pages of the script, which is the primary objective of the game. This game can be completed without obtaining all of them, however. The game focuses more on parodies of films at the different stages that are once more based on different genres of movies.

This game is different from the genesis version. Firstly, the characters have no health bar, lives (the game ends when all the characters are defeated/captured, one by one) or special abilities making the game highly difficult due to the one-hit kills. Secondly, there is the slot system, which is a slot machine at the bottom of the screen. It is activated after obtaining a certain number of coins and can be used for a range of power ups such as temporary invincibility or bringing back characters who were defeated or captured earlier.

Throughout the game, there are small robots with white block heads, red bodies and yellow appendages who work for Pinky and the Brain.

This game is probably complete (although the checksum is bad), and it was already licensed by Nintendo. The game was being made for Psygnosis, written by Simon Nicol, graphics by Herman Serrano, and music by Mike Clarke. It was to be released in 1994.

This game is a shooter in the vein of Asteroids. You pilot a space ship that shoots laser shots at moons of varying sizes. Hitting the moons gains you points for each hit, and destroying them at various sizes gives you more points. Before each stage begins, there are various power ups that fall across the screen. The power ups include:

- Speed Up (makes your ship faster)
- Rotate (allows you to rotate the ship 360 degrees)
- Missile (gives you one missile)
- Shield (makes you temporarily invincible)
- 1up (gives you an extra ship)

The control scheme is as follows:

- A/B: Shoots laser
- L: Rotate counterclockwise
- R: Rotate clockwise
- X: Shield
- Y: Missile

The goal of the game is to destroy the moons and gain points. Getting 10,000 points gains you a life. As you continue to shoot the moons, they begin to glow.

Destroyed one! However, this game is basically impossible to pass further than level 3 or so. Once the moons begin to glow, they start to move very rapidly (even faster than your ship), and quite often follow you until you eventually die. I suppose the trick to the game is to destroy the moons when they first come on the screen so that you can destroy them easily, as when they are large, they take a lot of hits to destroy. And even with missiles, the purple and blue moons still take far too many hits to die.

So, to remedy this situation, I created an infinite ships cheat:

7E1118 05

Using this cheat kind of defeats the purpose of the game as the moons are instantly destroyed if your ship hits them (though you get no points for this), but I decided to play with it on for a while.

Using the cheat, I was able to proceed to the far later levels. At around level 14, after the power ups fell down, I came across these objects (see picture on the left). I have no idea what they were, but they made a noise when I hit them. Now, on the picture to the right, you can see why the game basically becomes impossible in the later levels. Large moons just come after you, and you have no possible way to avoid them.

As I am unsure if this game is 100% complete, I will not give it ratings like I usually do. However, I will sum up the various aspects.

Graphics

Nothing spectacular here. The ship isn't spectacularly designed, and the moons seem designed based on actual planets in the solar system. The planetary meltdowns look cool for the 3 seconds you have before it destroys you. The backgrounds are essentially just a starscape, but it rotates around which is pretty cool.

Sound

The sounds are typical of many space shooters, like Gradius III. However, the voice samples are very muffled (the best example is at the Psygnosis title). Overall, the sound sounds muted. Plus it sucks that there is only one song throughout the game. It is pretty good for a snes game, but after a while it gets old.

Controls

The controls work fairly well in this game, although rotating your ship doesn't always work well enough when a moon is chasing you around. The controls are pretty solid and shooter fans shouldn't have much problems getting into it.

Well, there you have it. It was cool to be able to sample the game, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. If you are into old style arcade games, give it a shot, as I am not very good at them. I'm sure most people will have the frustrations with the rapid death that I did as well.

The Legend of the Card Masters

The land of Elemen has long been a gathering place for people from all over the known world. Rich in legend, long in tradition, there are many who see it as a land of unlimited opportunity. Some, in order to gain fame and fortune, have visited this land to fulfill their dreams.

According to the ancient legends, after the Reign of Evil instituted by the Empress Rimsala was toppled by the combined magic of the ancient order of the Card Masters, a long era of peace began in the kingdom. But there is a dark side of human nature that is ever-present in even the most ideal of lands. The six kingdoms on the island of Elemen were less than Utopian.

Disputes broke out constantly among these six kingdoms, but they were always minor and inconvenient, rather than dangerous. But in time these seemingly minor disputes became as a storm over the land. Eventually the conflict spread out over the whole island, with each of the kingdoms fighting independently for control of the island. This continued on for many years. The cities were turned to ruins, and despair covered the land.

Taking advantage of the times of unrest, Galneon, one of the court magicians, launched a coup against King Wagnall. The King was killed in the conflict, and the evil Galneon ascended to the throne. In the conflict the King's two daughters disappeared. Their whereabouts are unknown.

--From the SNES Arcana instruction manual.

Overview:

This one reminds me of Magic: The Gathering. It's a turn-based RPG in which the characters are cards, and I mean that literally. You, your party, and the bad guys are all displayed on cards. When in a fight, the cards will animate and do different things. The music is pretty traditional RPG music and not too bad, but don't wait for the victory music to end after a battle, it just goes on and on. The border designs and animated cards are awesome looking and fun to watch. I was a bit disappointed when I saw that the cards repeat a certain attack animation for every creature that falls into the same category, but it's still pretty cool. The view is first person and looks really good. As you move or turn, they generate a picture for the space in between the screen you're looking at and the one you're moving to. This way the turns look more animated and natural, not just jumping from one side to the other.

Directions:

Press A at the beginning of the game if you want to skip all the writing. The main character is Rooks. At the beginning of the game you are told he is the last Card Master. 

You start the game with 500 gold pieces and can buy things in town. The letters at the bottom of the screen in the weapons shop tell you who can equip that item. At the start of the game you only have R (Rooks) and T (Teefa). S is not Sylph since you can't equip spirits with anything. So now you know how many other party members you'll pick up along the way. Don't assume they all stick around, though. Buy weapons to increase your attack power, and armor and shields to increase your defense.

If you accidentally leave town, no worries, just turn around and head right back. Remember, turning left or right will show you the different buildings in town. When you're walking from a town to a dungeon or temple, you can press any button to end that animation. One of the most important things to remember is that the dungeons are few but very long and YOU CAN'T GO BACK. So, explore each dungeon thoroughly before moving on.

Menu Screen

'Look' allows you to open chests. When you see a treasure chest, press A then choose 'Look' from your options. 'Magic' shows you what magic your party has. From the magic menu you can select a spell to perform. Some spells can only be performed during combat. Moving the cursor to a spell will give you information on that spell. I recommend looking at these every time a party member gains a new spell, since you can't look at the meaning of the spell while in combat. 'Equipment' shows you what equipment you're carrying and who is wearing it. From here you can equip items to party members or unequip them. To move a piece of equipment in the list press A, then A again on the item you want to move, then move the red line down the list until it underlines the one you'd like to switch it with. If you discard an item, it's gone forever. 

The 'Separate' option will remove that equipment from whoever is using it, but you won't lose the equipment. 

'Call' will call a spirit. At the start of the game you only have Sylph. When you have entered the Call screen the controls are a bit different, in that you cannot exit with B. Simply press A while the spirit you want in the party is showing and you will no longer be in that menu. 'Ability' will show you everyone's level and give you a lot of information on your characters. Sylph's level is connected to Rooks's. 

'Inventory' will give you a list of what cards Rooks has and what items you have as a party. When you gain a new member sometimes you get new items, so check then. The cards and items lists can be organized in the same manner as the equipment list. In the cards and items list you can see a short explanation of what each is at the bottom of the screen. The 'Map' is only available in battle areas like temples and dungeons and will show you only where you've been. You cannot move the map. The exits and entrances are not marked on the map, so take note of where they are just in case you need to leave in a hurry. 

'Color' allows you to change the background color in the menu box. Not incredibly useful, but I played with it for a good ten minutes. 'Formation' allows you to move the characters in your party. I couldn't see that it made any difference in anything.

As you fight, you will gain experience and your Magic points and Hit points will go up, as well as your other attributes. Hit points are your life and Magic points allow you to perform magic spells like healing. Winning fights also gains you gold. Different creatures will give you different levels of gold and experience when you defeat them. You must keep all characters in party (except spirits) alive, or the game ends. If a spirit loses all its hit points, you can get it revived at a gypsy's tent.

Fighting Menu

When you are in a fight a new menu will appear. You can choose to attack and the character that has the red border will perform a basic attack. You can choose 'Magic' and that character will perform a spell that you choose if you have enough Magic Points to do it. 'Defense' will allow that character to defend and therefore avoid attacks better and take less damage from an attack that hits. If a character is low on life and you can't heal them, this is the option for them. The 'Weapons' option allows you to use spells within certain weapons. The Ice Blade sounds as if it would have something, but in fact it doesn't. This is the case: not every weapon that sounds 'spellish' will have something locked in it, so be careful what you spend your money on. 'Item' allows you to use an item. 'Retreat' will let you try to get away from the fight. 'Call' will allow Rooks to call a spirit. He is the only one with this option in his fighting menu.

You can call a spirit before you do anything else for free, calling a spirit doesn't count as your action. So, you can switch your spirit and then attack in the same round.

Different creature cards have different color borders and will take different amounts of damage from certain spells. For instance, a green border means Earth and is weak against wind. Eventually Sylph gains the ability to change your card color to wind (yellow) and that allows you to do more damage to Earth and other vulnerable creatures. {Changing your attribute to wind only lasts for that fight, but it works for you and your other non-spirit party members.}

You can also buy cards from the gypsy. Rooks uses these cards in combat with various effects against the enemies, similar to offensive spells. The more cards you use against the enemies the more effect you get. Also like spells, cards try to attack each enemy on the screen but don't always effect them all.

When your screen turns suddenly at the start of a fight and Rooks says "Yikes!", that means the monsters came up behind you and therefore will attack first. 

Controls:

A Button - Execute a Command, Open Menu
B Button - Exit Menu, Cancel Selection, Leave Shop/Building
Start Button - Starts Game
Select Button - Switch Between New Game and Continue

Hints:

Free Refills
While playing the game you may have noticed that your spirit's HP and MP increase when you move. This also happens if you just spin in place. If you do this while you are in a treasure chest square you will not be attacked by anything and can stay there, spinning in place, until your spirit is replenished.

Treasure!!!!
While in a dungeon or temple, make sure you go to the end of every hallway, right to the very end. There will be a lot of treasure chests at what look like dead ends, but you will only see them if you walk all the way to the end.

Tips:

Stage Select
At the title screen, press Down, Select, Select, X, Y, Select, Select, L, R, Select, Select, Left, Right, Up and then:
A for Stage 2
B for Stage 3
X for Stage 4
Y for Stage 5

Arcus Spirits is an overhead adventure game, somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda. You can choose between 4 characters and it had a Greecian theme to it. A beta version of the game was discovered, with the original Japanese name "Arcus Spirits" still on the title. The beta had the Wolf Team logo on it, suggesting they were preparing it for release. Renovation was purchased by Sega, so that is likely why the game never came out.

Information courtesy of Sakura Matsumoto:

A beta was leaked, however... it fails to credit Renovation (the company that translated it and was to publish it) or, in fact, any company except Wolfteam who made it and is still under the original title of Arcus Spirits (GoodSNES name: "Arcus Spirits (Beta)"), but seems to be otherwise completely translated. ^.^ (An oddity: the Sammy logo has been removed from the game, as Sammy had nothing to do with American publication, but was replaced with the Wolfteam logo instead of the Renovation logo.)

Changes in the North American Version:

When Titus published Ardy Lightfoot for North American audiences, several changes were introduced. These included numerous sprites, such as Ardy's "waiting" pose, being removed; tied up and crying animals being removed from the background on the forest level; and in level 6, "Eaten!", Catry's "pile of bones" sprite because of death by acid was replaced with a sprite of her lying on the ground as well the acid drip being removed from the ceiling.

The Elusive Doh!

For years, Commander Therle and his people have been searching for a new world to call home. Each time they get close, their enemy, Doh, pushes away Therle's ships. Recently, a sensor scan detected new terra-class planets. Therle sent scout ships to check them out, but Doh once again scattered his Blocks across the solar systems to stop the ships. Before the scout ships can reach the planets, they must destroy the Blocks.

--From the SNES Arkanoid - Doh it Again! instruction manual.

Overview:

So you may have thought Simpsons when you saw the title, and now you're a bit confused. Well, don't run away just yet. This is a pretty awesome Break-out style game. I love this type of game, and I think this one is a particularly cool one.

I have to say that one of my favorite things about it, corny as it may sound, is the noise the ball makes as it bounces off of things. It's almost musical. You may laugh, but that sound is something you hear over and over in Break-out games, and it's nice to have a pleasant one. Otherwise the sound effects include a nerve-grating electricity sound (caused by one of the enemies) and some O.K. explosions. There isn't any background music on any level, except for the boss level's ominous music.

The graphics are simple but fun for a Break-out game (though the animation of the ball is not very smooth), as they based this one in space. The backgrounds maintain the sci-fi space-ship theme. It's a very original idea to have the paddle be a space ship, I think.

Directions:

O.K. This isn't all that much different from a traditional Break-out game (you know, the kind you play on the computer at work when your boss isn't looking....), but with a bit of a twist. So ya read the storyline and ya know that it happens in space and you're trying to get through the blocks that the great and evil Doh *wild giggling* have placed in your path to stop you.

As in traditional Break-out, you have a paddle, in this one it's a ship, that you use to bounce a ball against bricks to destroy them.

If you miss the ball, it falls off the screen (presumably into the vast darkness of outer space) and you lose a life. Some bricks take more hits than others to break. In this game you also have enemies that can either make it easier or harder to beat that stage. Some get in your way, and some will destroy the blocks near them when you take them out.

Power-Ups

Here is a list of what each of the power-ups will Doh, uh, I mean, do. Catching a new power-up when you already have one replaces the current one with the new one unless otherwise noted.

B- Opens a warp point that'll take you to a higher stage. You can catch this one without losing your current power up.

D- Creates the insanity of 8 balls bouncing around destroying blocks.

E- Lengthens your ship, but only the first two times you catch it.

G- Makes your ship 'sticky' so that it catches the ball and holds it. To fire the ball back into play, press A. It won't hold the ball indefinitely.

L- Now your ship can fire lasers! Use them to blast most bricks.

M- The ball will destroy blocks and enemies without bouncing off of them. It will pass right through causing major damage. It does this with all blocks except gold blocks, which can't be destroyed.

P- Extra life. You can catch this one without losing your current power up.

S- Reverts your ship back to normal.

T- Creates an electric-looking catch net on either side of your ship that will bounce the ball back once if you miss it. You can catch other power ups without losing this one.

Doh! Forgot to tell you.... In this game you also have to defeat bosses. Keep smashing away at them 'til you defeat them, and stay outta the way of their debris, shots, and punches (yes, I said punches, but you'll have to play to find out what that means).

When playing in 2 player mode you can either take turns piloting the ship, play simultaneously, or play against each other. 

Controls:

A Button - Fire Lasers, Release Ball
B Button - Makes Ship go Faster
X Button - Same as A Button
Y Button - Same as B Button
Start Button - Start Game/ Pause
Select Button - N/A

Hints:

O.K. You Can See it
If you want to know what I meant about punches, you can just go and type in 713Z6!6?!LC2 in the password area, but understand that you won't be prepared!

Arn's Winter Quest: Gway Edition
Platform: Super NES
Region: Update Hacks
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 2006
Players: 1
Original Title: Earthbound
Hacked By: Radiation
Version: 1.02
_________________________

In the words of its creator, "Arn's Winter Quest has been a labor of love for me for two months, and rivals those hacks such as Hat Quest and EarthBound 2.5: Electric Boogaloo Joint Jive. It has a lot of fun inside jokes, an incoherent story, and all new battle graphics. This hack is basically linear Dragon Warrior with a bunch of humor thrown in, so if you like fighting and you like funny and you like very hard viewtiful fun time hacks, then don't play this hack because it'll satisfy your cravings and your head will probably explode."

There are also lots of bugs. Reset everytime you save in a new place. Actually save. If you die without save-reset, then you'll end up the first place you saved. If you haven't saved throughout the game, you'll be dropped in a death ocean.

Art of Fighting
Platform: Super NES

Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1994
Developer: SNK
Publisher: Takara
Players: 1 or 2 VS

The Art of Fighting series follows the conventions of the time in the sense that the player faces a variety of opponents in best two-out-of-three matches. Each of the game's characters have a unique fighting style and set of special techniques. The player has two basic attacks--punch and kick--as well as a utility button that switches between punches, kicks, and throws. A fourth button is used for taunting. Art of Fighting's contribution to the genre was the inclusion of a "spirit gauge" underneath the character's life bar. When characters perform special techniques, their spirit gauge is depleted and their special attacks become weaker. Players can also drain their opponent's spirit gauge by taunting them.

The Art of Fighting series was also the first fighting series to allow players to perform a "super attack." In the original Art of Fighting, the player's character learns a super attack (dubbed the super death blow) by completing one of the game's bonus rounds (this technique is available by default in the 3rd game). All three games (except the original Art of Fighting for the Neo Geo) also feature "Desperation Attacks" that can only be performed when the player's health is low and the life bar is flashing red.

The series also introduced graphical scaling into the genre: as the characters move away from each other, the camera will zoom out to keep both players on the screen. In previous fighting titles, the left and right sides of the screen acted as invisible boundaries; characters could only move as far from one another as the width of the screen permitted. Scaling allowed for a broader range of movement; the only boundaries in Art of Fighting are the edges of the stage. Character sprites in Art of Fighting change as the fight progresses to become more bruised and cut as damage is taken.

Assault Suits Valken
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Action
Release Year: 2002
Original Title: Assault Suits Valken
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
Assault Suits Valken is the Japanese version of Cybernator, a game that Konami brought over to America. The game is a sidescrolling shooter similar to Contra, but here you pilot a huge Mech named Gundam Valken. The main difference between this version and the US one is the story - a lot of things were removed by Konami for no reason, and the game paused itself while you received instructions during a mission in the US version. Valken doesn't do that, which may be a disadvantage - particularly against the last boss, who you can't attack until he shuts up. But he can attack you! Yep, unfair, but that's life.

Translation Description:

And here it is, the unedited, uncensored version of Cybernator! There are still some random text display issues, and you can't change Jake's name, but other than that it's fully playable!

YOU'RE IN A WORLD OF HURT.

Things are looking bad for a peaceful cluster of worlds in the Illis solar system. One of their reconnaissance satellites has picked up an evil presence 1.2 light years away - and it's drawing closer. The dark Armada of Annihilation pulses forward, devouring all the planets in its way, their vast array of weaponry poised and ready for any massive army that may try to stop them. However, it may not be a large force that can defeat them, but rather a force of one.

--From the SNES Axelay instruction manual.

Bahamut Lagoon
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 2002
Original Title: Bahamut Lagoon
Translated By: DeJap Translations, Neill Corlet
Version: 1.3
_________________________
*
You know, if I actually liked strategy RPGs, I think I would really like Bahamut Lagoon. This is one of those rare occasions where the Square whores are right, and this really is an "underrated gem," etc etc., unlike all the other Square RPGs that were never released here. Now don't get me wrong, Square is all right, I don't loathe them deep down inside or anything? I just hate all the Square fans that automatically proclaim anything Squaresoft as a gaming masterpiece, and any other RPGs can suck it. I mean, have these people even played Parasite Eve II? And don't get me started on Kingdom Hearts. Seriously.

Anyways, the first thing you will likely say once you start up the game will be "God damn, those are some pretty graphics." And they are. While most games are content to take Final Fantasy VI's graphics and run with them? well, Bahamut Lagoon does this too, but the graphics are updated and refined, and look really good. A lot of people nowadays will throw about the phrase "almost Playstation quality", but I don't know if I'd go that far. Definitely though, this is one of the best-looking games on the SNES. SFC, whatever. The soundtrack, by Noriko Matsueda, is pretty unimpressive. With the exception of a few nice songs, everything just kind of sounds the same. Throwing a few new instrument samples into the mix would've helped.

Naturally, for most fanboys the graphics would be more than enough to hail Bahamut Lagoon as an instant classic. Fortunately for the rest of us, the actual gameplay holds up well. Like I said, it's a strategy RPG. I only played up to the second battle and stopped cause, well, I'm not too big on the genre. You have your groups of fighters, represented by the lead character on the map, and when you attack, the game shifts into your typical RPG mode, where you can give Attack, Magic, Defend commands and such. Each group also has its own dragon, which it can control with three basic commands. The dragons will pretty much do their own thing, until you tell them to fall back, or stay close, or whatever. Sometimes when your group's in battle, the dragon will attack first, giving you a nice little advantage over the enemy. Did that make sense?

Also, the game uses terrain in a very unique way in combat. Terrain isn't just for attack modifiers or obstacles anymore: worried about the enemy crossing the bridge and taking your castle? Just use your magic and destroy the bridge. Then you just have to watch out for any ice magic they may use to freeze the river and make it crossable. Of course, you can always use your fire magic and melt the ice. See a cluster of enemies in the forest? Burn the forest down with your magic! Sure, it's not environmentally sound, but this isn't Rudra, you can do whatever you want.

In between battles is your typical RPG-style walking around. Talk to your gigantic cast of characters, check out the shops, sit through the story, stuff like that. The story doesn't seem that amazing at first (join the rebellion, save the princess, and take down the evil empire? Monomyth at its finest!), but maybe later on it'll get more interesting. Like I said, I didn't play too much of it. It's not that I dislike strategy RPGs, it's that they dislike me. I suck at those things. I'm shocked if I can get to the fifth battle in any strategy RPG. So maybe I'm not really qualified to do this here review, but there really isn't any other choice. It's not like anyone comes to the Whirlpool for reviews anyways. Right?

Translation Description

As far as I've played so far, this is a quality translation. I'd say it even rivals many commercial efforts. Dark Force, Neill, and Tomato should all be congratulated for this effort. In fact, as an assignment, you are all hereby ORDERED to read the readme, as it will give you a true appreciation for everything that went into this translation, maggots. Failure to comply will result in sexecution/s extreme disappointment.

The archive contains two ips files: one for emulators, and one for copiers (to be played on a real snes). Be sure not to mix them up!

Dark Force is currently working on a copier bugfix, at which point he will release a new patch with correctly translated item names as well. UPDATE [June 2007]: Seems this isn't happening.

Tips:

Ex Game
Once you clear the game once, hit reset at the ending screen, and you'll notice a new option on the title
screen, 'Ex Game'. Using EX game you can keep your levels, items, and gold.

Music Test
Hold the L & R buttons and press RESET to bring up the music test screen.

Original Title: Ball Bullet Gun
Translated By: Aeon Genesis

This game is a strange hybrid of Shining Force and Contra. That\'s the best way to describe it. It\'s a military strategy game in which your team of up to eight members has to complete a set of objectives in order to clear rounds. The game is fairly simple when it comes to gameplay, but you can customize your characters\' name and weaponry. Sometimes, the difference between a long range rifle and a Luger can make or break a game.

The game doesn\'t seem very complicated at the start, but as the missions get progressively harder, you have to plan out moves ahead of schedule, making sure that your enemies don\'t sneak up on you or remain hidden. PROTIP A hint: Use the Search command to look ahead! That\'s a very valuable weapon, so use it often.

Translation Description:

There are some emu-related bugs in the game, but overall, it's playable, so go snipe some enemy troops!

Ballz 3D
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1994
Developer: PF Magic
Publisher: Accolade
_________________________
*
Ballz is a two player 3D action fighting game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, the Super NES (SNES) and the 3DO. It was developed by PF Magic and published by Accolade in 1994. The 3DO version was released as a director's cut in 1995. Ballz offered three difficulty levels over a total of 21 matches. Its distinguishing quality was that each of the characters were composed completely of balls, with a pseudo-3D look.

Some attribute the game's poor performance in the marketplace to botched marketing. Accolade gave it little print advertising, but even the ads it did for the game gave little clue as to what type of game Ballz was. One just had an image of a Christmas Tree made of balls and contained the caption "Tell your mom you want Ballz for Christmas." The box of the game also gave little hint of the type of game it was, since it depicted just a jumbled image of numerous balls. Some assumed it was some sort of Tetris clone.

The opening of the game PF Magic developed for the game stated "To be the champion, you gotta have Ballz!" Due to its racy double-entendre ("balls" may be used as a slang term for testicles), Nintendo demanded the wording be changed for the SNES version. The SNES version of the game states, "...you gotta play Ballz," while the Sega version uses the original intro. The game was also notably bizarre for its lineup of fighters, which included a farting monkey, an air-humping clown, a caveman, a ballerina, a rhinoceros, and a male figureskater.

Tips:

Sticky Ballz
On the main code screen, hold R and press A, B, A, X, Y, A

Turbo Mode
Press 'A' 9 times at the title screen.

Morph into other fighters

"If Barbie is so popular, then why do you have to buy her friends?"

So yeah, I'm guessing you're wondering what a 20-year-old male is doing sitting around playing a game called "Barbie Super Model" when I could be out playing other games? Well...to be honest, I have no idea except for the fact that I saw that "This game got bad reviews, is it REALLY that bad?!". So yeah, I decided once again to take control of a plastic woman as she goes about her pre-programmed day of fun in who-cares-where...oh, wait, Barbie is in Hollywood? Well gee, I should've guessed that. We all know that all little girls dream of being a model in Hollywood, where the movie stars shine like lightbulbs, so you don't need streetlights when you're out at night. People who are Hi-Tech decided to make this game, but really, there's nothing high tech about a plastic bimbo who wears either lavish, skimpy, or obnoxious clothing and who has a nonsensical daily routine involving going somewhere, daydreaming, and modeling.

So I turned the game on, and I instantly noticed, when I finally saw Barbie, that her hair looked like a bunch of yellow animal tails glued on her head, looking so thick that squirrels could hibernate in her hair for years at a time without her even noticing at all. I questioned myself as to if I should press Start...and I did.

I was treated to seeing Barbie write in her obviously blank journal about what was on her mind...driving a car! Well, Barbie, you sure are a complicated one to figure out! So then we go on the road with Barbie's blindingly-bright pink car, making her stand out like wearing Safety Orange in the middle of a war battle. You can move Barbie around up and down, and you can move at three speeds. Basically, the speeds are 23 mph, 25 mph, and 26 mph, so whichever way you drive, the air-headed plastic woman doesn't have the mental capacity to slam on any pedal, so you're stuck along a ride through hollywood where hearts and stars with B's on them litter the streets instead of candy wrappers, mud puddles, and papers. People then drive around like mindless morons. The people on the road drive so bad you think they got their driver's licenses out of a box of Cocoa Puffs. Either they just sit there and not bother to move, or they purposely try to swerve into Barbie to knock her off the road.

Since this version of Hollywood has no such thing as police officers or road rage, you simply stop in one place and lose a B heart, then continue on your way. Miraculously, cars are never damaged, so in this version of Hollywood, you don't need a mechanic...ever!

Occasionally you'll find purses or suitcases or whatever the hell they are lying about the road too. Running over them gives you the reward of matching Barbie's looks with that of her own magazine. I don't know why you would, but hey, it's Barbie the plastic fashion disaster, so yeah...

You'll either end up having to mimic her clothes or her makeup look. For the clothes, just hit the D-Pad until you come up with the right look. Not surprisingly, Barbie has more clothes than the Salvation Army gets in five years, so you'll probably be a while with that. The makeup thing is about the same.

So then after the crazed ride, you get to the end of Hollywood St. and you end up in a gym where you practice Barbie's runway routine. Just press some buttons and keys and she'll go and spin around, walk with her butt obviously shaking, pose, and other things that involve looking like model who makes no sense. You can do this as much as you want until you finally press the start button. Then you just drive back in the same fashion you did before. Now...here's the amazing part... You do the routine WITHOUT HELP! Oh, WOW! Gee, how hard could that be! So yeah...do the routine and you beat the level.

Then now, instead of going out for a leisurely drive, Barbie decides to go read a book on the beach to dream about roller-skating. So then now you have to go roller-skating with her because the obnoxious background music woke her up and now the intelligence-challenged woman has nothing better to do with her time. Barbie moves about as fast as her car, so you wonder why she even went out driving before when she could've just roller-skated in the street, and you'll probably wish she had by this point. Now you have to dodge birds, frisbees, and other people as you roll around the boardwalk. Same routine crap as last time, then you go back and shake your little tush on the catwalk just like Right Said Fred said way-back-when.

After doing that, you' now suddenly shift climates and go up onto the mountains! Barbie is dressed up in an outfit so gaudy that would make wearing MC Hammer-like pants in Africa look normal. After watching her write in her diary thing, she goes out for a walk, and you have to avoid more stupid things like snowballs, ice, and people dragging sleds behind them.

About this time, I got tired of watching Barbie fall on her petit little rump that she shakes on the catwalk all the time, so I finally shut off the game.

I totally learned a few things about playing this game. First off, its best use is not as an entertainment device, but as a tool for lowering people's IQ. Grab the smartest kid in your class, tie them up in your father's easy chair, and make them play this game for a few hours and I guarantee they'll become a drooling idiot. Coasters and doorstops are way too nice, so I'd also prefer rifle targets and bonfire fuel for a game like this. Little girls don't need to bother with this plastic super (crappy) (role) model. Just give the kids something better to do.

Secondly, I learned that Barbie's stuff consists of gaudy colors and makeup that would make a garbage can full of medical waste more attractive. Seriously, Barbie, if you're going to be in a super model game, please don't wear horrendous clothing that make me want to pluck out my own eyes and eat them.

Third, I did learn that the controls were a little better than I thought they were going to be, though it's definitely not a game you'd want to play long anyway.

And last, but definitely not least, Barbie...please listen to better music. I'd rather buy an album made from people who smoked ten packs a day for fifty years than listen to a single tune in your library.

Overall...yeah. This game was total crap.

Rick Rating: Avoid like a bad fashion statement.

"Rule #2: Plastic women are boring to go on vacations with."

After playing Barbie Super Model and watching that crash and burn about as fast as it takes to knock her flat on her ass with a frisbee, I decided to see if the other title, Barbie's Vacation Adventure, was also as bad as people were saying it was. Believe me, it made swallowing a mini-van whole sound like a better alternative to my time. But because I'm completely impervious to the mind-numbing tactics of air-headed dolls with Mattel liscenses, I decided to try Hi-Tech's other misleading game with Barbie in it.

I turn on the game, and once again I see that the woman is about as lovely as a nasty car wreck victim and has the figure with the appeal of a bent spoon. Quickly, I go to the Options menu. By some saving grace, it looks like Hi-Tech gave us the option of turning the music and sound effects off! However, for the purposes of this review, I had to leave them on.

So then I started the game. There were five areas available to me at the start, so nothing much was a complete surprise except for the icons that were used to represented. Wyoming is represented with a camera so you can take pictures of the locals and local wildlife. Iowa is represented with a clown because we know that all clowns come from the state of Iowa. Florida is represented by scuba gear, which surprisingly, makes some slight bit of sense. Texas is represented by a horse, which I guess actually makes a bit of sense too. However, California is represented with a present, which leads me to believe that all birthdays take place in California, and as well Santa Claus lives there wearing shorts and a tank top. You knew that things associated with Barbie (aside from the girls that play with them) just weren't capable of making sense with three things in a row, didn't you? Of course.

So naturally, being up north in the forests of Maine, I decide to go visit the clowns in Iowa. It so happens that Iowa is having a county carnival! Now, just so you know, I seriously enjoy carnivals like I enjoy a good, swift kick in the groin, so I'm walking into this carnival as Barbie trying to play it cool like an airheaded plastic doll would.

But all would be lost if we couldn't assemble Barbie's wardrobe! Yes, before we go into the carnival, we have to sit around and play dress-up. Only there isn't much dress-up here, Barbie just has a few colors of skirts and shorts she can wear, unlike the vast amount of gaudy, skimpy, and outright bizarre outfits that would quickly make her top candidate for "Worst Dressed" in every magazine known to mankind that has to do with famous people. So I decide that she's going to wear a pink outfit for the carnival, since I didn't feel like trying to figure out what colors would look good and what would make her look like something akin to a girl in an African tribe.

So in Iowa, we have to help her catch a pig for some dude named Farmer Brown. Obviously, the deformed farmer is too busy walking around aimlessly with A.D.D, so it's Barbie's job to catch that hog. Catching it was as easy as just waiting for it to walk by and press Y. She doesn't even attempt to grap the thing, the pig immediately stops because Barbie has all the right accessories, clothing, and fashion sense to make any living thing alive freeze dead in their tracks, either to admire her fashion sense or laugh in her face about how much of a ditz she is. So now she's happy that she can play her rigged carnival games. Wonderful! So the hog follows her over to play a game of "Knock over the cans". Even though the cans are moving, they're ridiculously easy to hit and can be done in well under the 90-second time limit by anyone, even those who can't see. Then the next game involves throwing baseballs at clown heads. Same old easy crap as before, but with a ball limit instead of a time limit.

Then there's the classic "Test of Strength" game, where it's fairly difficult to make Barbie actually hit the bell. Regardless, you get points anyway and you continue along with the pig trailing you and following your every footstep as if the thing was yours and not Old Farmer Brown, so it's not like the game cares about your strength, it only cares about how bizarre your plastic woman looks in-game.

So I finally get done at the carnvial...and LOOK! OH MY GOD!!! Barbie sent ME!! A POSTCARD!!! It doesn't say much, as it looks like it took her every brain cell in her head to describe in about twenty-five words what she did. So then we move onto the next thing since Barbie was about as fun as sticking your finger in fan blades at the fair.

Next was a good ol' fashioned campout in Wyoming. Once again, we choose an outfit for the bimbo to go camping in, and this time I chose Green for no other reason except that I hoped she would blend in with the forest so I didn't have to look at her. Then we arrive at what has to be the ugliest forest that I have ever seen in my entire life. For someone that has a life around fashion, she sure picked the worst forest ever to camp out at. I get the feeling that nothing in the forest is actually green, and is instead twisted to reflect the colors that dwell inside Barbie's non-existant brain. So she now asks for help in pitching a tent, and tells me what it should look like. I don't know about you, but would you let a manufactured woman tell you what a tent looks like? Regardless, we fit the tent together like a jigsaw puzzle and then Barbie the Manufactured Ditz is happy.

So now I decide to go for a rock, where I have to help her skip over the rocks to avoid getting wet. After amusing myself a few times in getting her well-thought-out outfit all wet, but in reality, all she did was get about ankle-high in a brook or something. Goes to show ya how fashion-freakish Barbie is. So when you get to the end, Barbie wants to take pictures of the wildlife. After shooting a bunch of the wildlife, making faces in the camera, and falling asleep because Barbie walks so slow that elderly people could outrun her with ease, you finish.

Next I decided to go send Barbie off to Florida after seeing her second meaningless postcard. Once again, Barbie's at the beach! I pray that a frisbee will knock her on her ass again as I continue on. I picked a gaudy swimsuit for her so boys would vomit when she passed by. Now, she decides to go swimming and look for some pirate ship! Surprisingly, she doesn't turn into some freakish Mermaid Barbie or even do anything exciting such as drown. After scuba-diving for gems got boring in say...less than a minute, tops, I made her go back to the beach for a game of Volleyball. The game was unimaginably exciting as my opponent had the volleyball skill of a person with no arms or legs and Barbie won quite easily. I left that and decided to head off to Texas.

After attire arrangement to something equally as nauseating, Barbie decided that the horses would be fun to ride! So she hops on them and goes for a ride on the obstacle course. The horse sounds like someone drumming their fingers on a bongo drum and the riding is about as tedius as it looks when the horse is jumping, that in reality, it looks like it's not even jumping at all! Great job, Barbie! You picked a magical horse! While you're at it, why can't you see if it can fly, make rainbows, and eat its own head! She then got to play a game of horseshoes, since you know, Texas is nothing but horse country. After ten quick throws, I finished and got tons of points no matter what she did. Barbie could've hit one of the horses and killed them and still got about five-hundred points for it, for cryin' out loud.

I got bored of Texas extremely quickly, so I went back to her place in California. After more tacky attire assortment, and another lousy postcard, I could feel that i wanted to pound my head with a nice, blunt object until everything turned black. Quickly, I went to see what was in store for Barbie. Oh, look at this! It's a party! However, the people who threw it seem to have lost the concept of what a "party" is. First, the presents are hidden all around her house, so now she has to look for them. I don't think I've heard of a party where everyone in the house tells you to look for your own damn presents. Secondly, if this is Barbie's party, then why is no one paying attention to her? After finding a present, you have to guess what it is in order for you to get it. I got like, one, then I just looked for the nearest way out, but I had to go and find all the lame gifts first. Then after you find all of her presents...you win a brand new ugly pink car!

And then I get thrown back on the world map. Again. There's no end to this game. You just keep on doing the same boring and repetitive stuff until it gets boring and repetitive. And the music and sound effects, which can be turned off, should DEFINITELY be turned off, since it sounds worse than a cat, elephant, and a chain smoker trying to sing opera.

I've definitely learned a few things after playing this game. One, for someone who leads a supposedly glamorous life, Barbie is nothing more than a boring ditz.

Secondly, this game actually had more to do in it than walking back and forth, shaking your ass on the catwalk. However, it was just as fun as doing Barbie's routine in the last game, which it was basically not.

Third...once again, coasters and doorstops would be offended by this thing. So would burning it. The best thing to do is to just pour some random chemicals onto it and see what happens. If you're lucky, the game just might melt or explode!

Rick Rating: Don't go. Do like Wally Bear's parents say. "Stay smart! Don't Start!"

"Thank you, mom. I will remember..."

Any doubts about my complete and total suckage at fighting games can be officially put to rest, ladies and gentlemen. But I'd like to at least TRY and figure this one out, because it looks super cool! So it's a fighting game (like I said) that mostly involves various projectiles. And by "mostly," I don't mean your cheapass roommate throwing hadokens across the screen one after another. I mean, there is very little hand-to-hand combat involved. It's somewhat hard to explain in the way I want to explain it, but you can walk or fly around on this fixed plane, like a square. And the opponent is off on another plane across the playing field from yourself. So you mostly throw fireballs like a fiend and hope to God that one of them connects.

It's a cool game with awesome graphics, so try it out! You'll probably like it. Nyah.

Translation Description:

This is actually a joint project between DeJap and Anus P. of J2e Translations. Apparently Dark Force has trouble with the game too, because he hacked an instant-kill trainer into the game. See and find it! Yay!

HAVOC IN GOTHAM PLAZA

Gotham City is in the midst of a jubilant holiday celebration. The mayor is giving his annual speech before the lighting of the Christmas tree in Gotham Plaza, when, much to the surprise of the crowd, a huge gift box appears at the back of the plaza. As the crowd quiets, the box erupts with the roar of powerful engines. Skull-masked motorcyclists, flame-breathing clowns and knife wielding acrobats storm the crowd, striking terror where moments before there had been glee.

Police Commissioner Gordon, on hand for the celebration, quickly sends word to the precinct headquarters: "Send the signal! We need Batman here quickly."

Miles away, in stately Wayne Manor, millionaire bachelor Bruce Wayne looks up from his desk. A series of mechanised mirrors has detected the Bat-Signal and reflected it through a window in Wayne's study. At that moment, his faithful butler Alfred enters the room. "Sir, shall I prepare?" Alfred asks. He knows the answer already, for his employer has never refused a call.

"Yes, Alfred." Wayne's brow furrows as he heads toward a large aquarium in the center of the room. "Any idea what's happening?" He rolls up his sleeve, plunges his arm into the fish tank and presses a button on an ornamental castle. Behind him a secret panel opens to reveal a passage.

Alfred follows him through the door. They walk through the passageway leading to the hidden Batcave. "There is some commotion at the Plaza, Sir," Alfred responds.

Once inside the Batcave, Alfred takes a seat at a bank of computer terminals. Bruce Wayne activates a console panel beside a large vault door. In a few seconds the vault opens. Inside are a number of armoured Batman suits and a vast array of high-tech weapons. He scans the suits. "What's the situation, Alfred?" he calls out.

At the monitors, Alfred has intercepted a local satellite feed of a newscast. He sees the thugs wreaking havoc on the citizens. "Approximately twenty strong. Wearing what appears to be circus costumes - no sign of armour. Weapons noted include knives, flame throwers, possibly small arms. Most on foot, some motorcycles."

"Thanks. Link with the Batmobile and keep me apprised of the situation." He dons a suit of light armour with good flexibility. "I'll go in at ground level from the east of the plaza. If you see anything to dictate otherwise, let me know".

As Bruce pulls on the rubber cowl of his suit, Alfred hits a remote control button which starts the engine on the Batmobile. A moment later, Batman leaps into the cockpit and speeds away to rescue Gotham City once again!

Gotham City is celebrating their Christmas celebration with the lighting of the tree, or so they thought.

Batman: Revenge of the Joker, also known as "really crappy Batman" was going to be released by Sunsoft in 1992. The company that developed it was Icom Simulations. It was released on the Genesis and NES, but was likely not released on the snes because it was too bad. The thing that gets me is that the enemy patterns have a distinct behaviour that reminds me of Total Recall for the NES. The rom of the game is floating around should you feel the need to play this.

Virg, which rests in the middle of the Great World, has remained a tranquil land for many centuries. Here, all beings live in peace, under the secure hold of a powerful Warrior-King. These Kings are chosen in a contest of champions, in which warriors from every corner of the land compete.

But something is about to disturb the harmony of Virg. A netherworlder by the name of Autarch has sent forth spirits to possess the high warriors of the land. With the best warriors of Virg under the command of Autarch, the tournament of champions, and the fate of Virg, are in dire jeopardy.

--From the SNES Battle Blaze instruction manual.

Overview:

This fighter was a pretty bad game. The only thing that was good were the graphics and music. The graphics were drawn well and used bright colors. The music sounded good and wasn't repetitive, but the sound effects weren't good at all. The story sounded regurgitated, it's almost exactly like Mortal Kombat.

The biggest drawback was the controls. If there is one thing fighting games are known for it's a ton of special moves to preform. This game had one button that you used to attack out of a total of six. There were a few special attacks, but nowhere near enough. There also weren't enough different characters to choose from. If you play one player mode, you have to be Kerrel. If you play two player mode, there are only six different people to choose from. This fighter just didn't bring enough to the table to feed most gamers' needs.

Directions:

If you play the two player mode, all you have to do is pick your fighter and try to beat up your opponent by tapping the Y button. If you play one player, you will have to defeat all the other five characters and Lord Autarch, by pressing the Y button as fast as you can.

The six characters are: Kerrel- a human barbarian; Snouser- a half-man / half-dog thing (a mog?); Adrick- a human swordsman; Land- twin brother of Kerrel; Tesya- a woman trained to be deadly with two daggers; and Lord Gustoff- a half-orc with a morningstar.

During battle you will have two life bars, one yellow and one red.

Both will have to be depleted to die. You will have to be killed twice to lose the fight. There are a few special moves to learn, but not many. Most of them are initiated by pressing forward or back twice. There are no power-ups or items to collect, just fight your way through.

Controls:

Y Button - Strike
B Button - Jump
Down + Y Button - Low strike
Down + B Button - Low kick

Hints:

Infinite Credits
Enter the following code at the Title Screen:
Hold Select then Hold Start, release Select.
Then at the Options Screen Hold L and Press Up + X - Left + Y - Down + B - Right + A then release L.

Talk about road rage, you're in a car armed with missiles, grenades and all manner of other weapons. Race around the world and destroy the competition, literally. Good Luck, Racer!

This racer/shoot-em-up game is a great game for a good time. The graphics are good in that you can clearly make out your car as well as the challengers, and even the city in the background, which changes view as you turn rather than stay the same. The music keeps up with the fast pace of the game and keeps your heart pumping. So if you like racing and shoot-em-up games, then this is the perfect game for you.

Directions:

Battle Cars takes the term road rage to a whole new level. You race twice in one location, the first is to qualify in the standings. Earn cash and credits so you can buy upgrades to your vehicle (Pimp my Ride ain't got nothin' on this) such as weapon upgrades likes disks, missiles, and grenades, as well as better shocks, tires, and turbo for your car.

After that, you are challenged by the area's champ. Be careful not to get hit too many times, or else your competition will blow you up. Two player mode allows you to race as a team, or you could go head to head against each other in an all out battle. All in all this game is worth playing and will have you racing for hours. Enjoy!

Controls:

A Button - ACCELERATE
B Button - FIRE WEAPON
X Button - BRAKES
Y Button - CHANGE WEAPON
L Button - SHARP TURN LEFT
R Button - SHARP TURN RIGHT
Start Button - PAUSE
Select Button - N/A

Tips:

Code-Alternate Car Color
Highlight a car at the selection screen then press A + Select + Start. You will now be able to choose a color
for your car.

Boss Car
At the title screen, press L, R, Up. When you reach the boss, you'll be driving his car

Heedless of warnings from nature and of social unrest, human society collapsed even as the 21st century ushered in a new era of technology. In the wake of riots, food shortages and crime, cities became ruins and were divided into armed camps. Natural disasters made life difficult for those who survived the collapse. Earthquakes and volcanoes devastated several of the earth's great metropolises. In this world of anarchy, human life was full of violence, hatred and hopelessness. The only source of amusement for these people was the Battle Game.

The Battle Game pitted two fighters against each other in arena-like combat. For the amusement of the masses, advanced technology was twisted to create giant, armored riot suits, actually hydraulically powered humanoids, called "Standing Tanks" or STs for short. Battles Between these metal monsters continued until only one combatant was left standing. Those who survived a lose in the arena became low class citizens and were forced to serve the winners.

But not all accepted their lots in life. Although his father had been defeated in the Battle Game, young Mike Anderson refused to live with the station forced on him by the Battle Game's codes. He was determined to seek vengeance on the fighter who had defeated his father: Anubis and his ST, THANATOS. Mike dedicated his life to learning all he could about the technology of the STs: their weapons, mechanical workings and defensive systems.

As Mike trained his mind and his body, however, Anubis continued to win more power in the Battle Game. Anubis promoted the best fighters in the Battle Game to be his "Chiefs." With this title each was given control over a portion of the ruined earth. Rather than issuing a standard Battle Game Challenge to another ST, Mike was faced with a more dangerous undertaking. He had to fight his way through Anubis's Chiefs to reach his ultimate goal: a battle clash to the finish with Anubis and his ST THANATOS.

Banpresto League Soccer is basically what this is. You have your Ultraman team, and your Gundam team, and your Masked Rider team, and etc etc., and it's all very cartoony and SD and cutesy. I tried playing a game and it was really weird. Why was I playing as both teams? I think a manual of some kind is definitely in order.

Translation Description:

There's screens that come up before every match that say what world you're playing in, which are still in Japanese. Other than that, everything is translated. The font could be better though, but hey.

Following her crushing defeat at the hands of the Battletoads on Ragnarok's World, the humiliated Dark Queen hightailed it to the outer reaches of the Universe.
Months have passed...and the Queen's parting threat of revenge has become a distant memory to Professor T. Bird and the Battletoads...

However, when a mysterious energy beam from outer space renders Earth's military might powerless, and a city-sized spaceship called the Colossus smashes out of the moon, the Professor knows it has to be the Dark Queen trying her latest galaxy-dominating plan.
He's right, of course, but what he doesn't realize is that the shady lady's taking no chances this time, and she's cunningly teamed up with the equally shady Shadow Boss! This means that the Battletoads will not only have to fight the Queen and her sidekicks, General Slaughter, Big Blag and Robo-Manus - but Abobo and Roper, the Shadow Boss's minions, as well!

So, that's how it stands, 'toads: the Dark Queen's got herself some serious back-up and now she's comin' to take over you Earth - what're ya gonna do about it?
First of all, you're gonna get the sides EVEN! Those terrific twins, Billy and Jimmy Lee, otherwise known as the Double Dragons, are just rarin' to get in on the action, 'specially since the Shadow boss is their archest of enemies!

--From the SNES Battletoads Double Dragon instruction manual.

Overview:

Use one of the Battletoads or one of the Double Dragons to save the world from evil. The Battletoads and the Double Dragons make a great team. I especially liked the graphics on this game. They were well rendered and I love their use of color. This was one of the first games I played that contained the lead characters from two different game series. Double Dragon used to be one of my favorite NES games as a kid, and so was Battletoads. It was a great idea to put them together in the same game. If you like arcade style brawlers, play this one!

Directions:

You can choose from any of the Battletoads or you can choose Billy or Jimmy. The controls are a little weird to get used to, but once you do it's pretty easy. The gameplay is the usual side scrolling beat-em-up. This one did incorporate some new moves for the characters, and still had your favorite old ones.

Controls:

A Button - Attack
B Button - Jump
X Button - Attack
Y Button - Jump
Start Button - Start, Pause
Select Button - Select

Hints:

At a converted fortress, Gyachung-La, high in the Tibetan mountains, the Psicone Corporation is testing its latest invention - the T.R.I.P.S. 21, an acronym for Total Reality Integrated Player System.

T.R.I.P.S. 21 allows a person to actually enter the Gamescape through a unique, computer-generated portal; anyone passing into the portal will have his or her atoms integrated into the Gamescape by a complicated process of quantum-mechanical osmosis.

Present at the test are Mrs. Yuriko Tashoku, President of the Psicone Corporation, her daughter Michiko, Professor T. Bird, and the 'toadally awesome trio, Zitz, Rash and Pimple, otherwise known as the BATTLETOADS.

The portal is switched on and the Gamescape is revealed: a rolling plain with four figures barely visible in the distance. Gradually, the figures get closer and are seen to be four Psyko Pigs mounted on horseback - the Pigs of the Apocalypse.

Suddenly, the Pigs gallop straight at the portal, bursting through it and into the test room. One of them grabs Michiko Tashoku and leaps back through the portal. When Zitz tries to stop them, he is clubbed senseless and draped over a saddle. Before anyone else can do anything, the Pigs of the Apocalypse are galloping away into the Gamescape with their two captives - and to make matters worse, the Gamescape begins to leak through the portal into our world!

A prerecorded message flashes up on the Gamescape screen, confirming Professor T. Bird's suspicion that the evil genius, Silas Volkmire, and his malevolent partner, the Dark Queen, are behind the kidnapping and the Gamescape leakage, and it is soon revealed that he is correct: Silas has hooked himself up to a Gamescape Generator somewhere beyond the portal, with the wicked intention of transforming the entire world into his very own Gamescape Kingdom, over which he and the Dark Queen will rule. Meanwhile, Michiko and Zitz are being conveyed to his dreaded lair, the Dark Tower, where they will be destined for doom if anyone tries to stop him.

--From the SNES Battletoads in Battlemaniacs instruction manual.

Overview:

Classic side-scroller, just like the previous Battletoads games. As always, great graphics and sound make for a super fun brawler.

Directions:

Fight the baddies in order to get to the end of the level. They are some unique stages as well! You'll use different combos to fight opponents if you keep button-mashing! Both Rash and Pimple have different attacks, which makes the gameplay more interesting and fun.

Controls:

A Button - Jump
B Button - Attack
X Button - Pick up, put down
Y Button - Jump
Start Button - Pause/Unpause
Select Button - Selects sound option in character select screen

Hints:

"Aaaaahhhhh! Everybody run! It's Bebe's Kids!!!"

Games based on movies are rarely spectacular but I do enjoy them most of the time so when I heard about Bebe's Kids being an awful game I thought game critics and my fellow gamers were just overreacting to a mediocre game. How wrong I was; Bebe's Kids is an awful game with bad controls and repetitive gameplay crush that what little this game has to offer.

High Points:
Nice cut scenes

Low Points
Repetitive gameplay
poor graphics
unresponsive controls

Graphics: 4/10
The graphics start off with some nice cut scenes but after that you'll be staring at sub-par backgrounds and cheaply animated characters. To make matter worse there will be large amounts of slowdown while fighting even though there are only 2 enemies on the screen!

The first few stages have bland backgrounds but once you get to the haunted house level the graphics do get better. It's still cheaply animated but there is a much better variety in the backgrounds now like attacking portraits.

Very nice cut scenes too
.
Music and Sound: 4/10
For about 6 seconds the music was cool; that is until you realize that it just loops over and over and over and over again. As for the sound effects; decent punching and kicking noise.

What else can I say? The sound is just terribly uninspired. Bring your own music before playing this game.

Story
The three social misfits, Lashawn, Kahlil, and Pewee are taken to Funworld amusement park, where all hell breaks loose. In the movie it was funny, in the game it's just plain hell. All the humor from the movie is poorly represented in the game.

Gameplay 1/10
Bebe's Kids plays like a Final Fight clone where you start off fighting a costumed rat and a security guard. You punch them-alot-for about 2 minutes until they lose their mask/hair and then eventually pass out. Then you do it again, and again until the time runs or you reach the end of the stage. That's basically it for the first stage, which is pretty hard since the timer will probably run out on you.

In the second stage you have to smash the dishes that the baby Pewee throws down before their baby sitter (Robyn) catches it. It may sound simple, and it should be,but the controls are a nightmare. There is like a 2 second delay from the time you press the attack button to the time the kid actually sticks out his/her stiff arm and smashes it. If he does catch one you have to start the whole hellish cycle all over again.

The third stage has some more of that horrid fighting but eventually you'll run into a haunted house where the game turns quarter way decent! The controls still suck, the animation is still poor but instead of punching hair off of security guards you have find your way out of the haunted house, a task I have yet to accomplish. It's a maze and everytime I think I've figured it out the damned game drops me back at the entrance, it gives frustration a new name.

Control: 2/10
At first the controls don't seem that bad, I mean they are stiff and slow but I could work with them for the first level since all you need to do is mash the punch button. In the second stage the controls started to act up since you need fast reflexes to smash the dishes and you couldn't do that all the time with these controls. By the third level the controls from hell made something as simple as a jumping over a projectile more frustrating than it should have been. There is also a delay in the controls; like in Mortal Kombat 1 for the SNES; you'll press the button and 'feel' a delay in the kid's attacks and jumping. Not to mention the fact that the overall speed of the game is slow.

Challenge: 10/10
This is the only category a crappy game like this can get a 10 in. This a hard game, a very, very hard game although most of the challenge can be contributed to the super cheap design, most of the time I lost due to the time running out; not from losing my entire life bar.

Good luck on the Haunted House; I don't know ANYONE who has ever beat that level. If you do know how to beat it...please go to the Bebe's Kid's message board!

Replay Value: 0/10
This a little premature since I haven't beaten the game but I think I can safely say that I won't ever even touch this game after I'm through with it.

Overall: 1/10
I usually enjoy movie games; even though they have never been amazing (Goldeneye being an exception) but this is taking a bad game way too far. It's a shame too because Bebe's Kids was a great movie and this game makes it look really bad. I have to admit that once I advanced in the game I didn't think it was the worst SNES game anymore {gives icy stare to Rise of the Robots} although it is still lousy. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone except those who collect SNES games.

Everyone else: run away; run far far away!

Best of the Best: Championship Karate is a Kick Boxing game that features black belt kick Boxing masters. The object is to win the kick Boxing championship by defeating an array of Kick Boxing masters in a series of fighting matches.

Originally titled "Panza Kick Boxing" on home microcomputers in Europe, the game was retitled to "Best of the Best: Championship Karate" when it transitioned to home video game consoles. Note that the latter name makes little sense, given that the game is about Kick Boxing, not Karate.

Release Year: 1995
Developer: LucasArts
Publisher: JVC
_________________________
*
Big Sky Trooper is a sci-fi adventure game, produced by JVC and LucasArts for the Super NES in January 1996. At the start of the game, the player chooses an avatar, male or female, before the story begins; the evil Space Slug forces, led by the Sultan of Slime, have launched a sudden attack on humanity, quickly occupying the majority of planets in the galaxy, and forcing the Sidereal Shock Troops to recruit soldiers to counter the threat. After passing three "grueling tests", the player is made a "21-star general" and transported to the E.S.S. Dire Wolf, where he meets the ship's Flexible Interactive Digital Omnicomputer (FIDO, represented by a dog). From this point, the player receives various orders, from rescuing stranded agents on various cartoon-like worlds, retrieving upgrade parts for the ship and the player, and repairing various machines which help keep the universe running.

The vast majority of the game, however, is spent hunting down and driving the Slugs off different planets; when arriving at an occupied world, the game switches to an overhead Asteroids-esque view, where the Dire Wolf must shoot down all enemies (beginning with small, weak ships, with larger ones featured later in the game). After this, the player dons a suit of powered armor and descends to the planet's surface to hunt down the Slugs (which actually resemble green blobs capable of splitting and combining, if necessary). Once this is finished, any additional tasks (such as speaking to people, opening up passages to the different machines) can be completed, or the player can return to the Dire Wolf and head to the next planet.

It should be noted that the general plot of the game (planets conquered by alien invaders, player is suddenly recruited and must don power armor to retake them) is similar to the novel Starship Troopers.

Developer: Hudson Soft
Publisher: Hudson Soft
_________________________

Unlike in real basketball, players can physically check each other on the court without the threat of personal or team fouls. Destructive items such as bombs frequently appear on the court. The game often receives criticism for oversimplified controls (using only one button in addition to the directional pad to perform all in-game actions,) lack of injuries/destruction (like in Mutant League Hockey and Mutant League Football), and predictable AI. Bill Laimbeer, a now-retired basketball player licensed his name and image to this game at a point in his career when he was notorious for his aggressive and physical play.

The game predicts a science-fiction version of the year 2030 in which there are only robot basketball players (excluding Bill Laimbeer). Basketball teams play in gruelling league matches where new players are bought and sold. Within this future, basketball uses a dedicated robot to perform the toss up at the start of each match as referees had been fired by Bill Laimbeer sometime prior to the year 2030. As a result, players now wear armor to their games and weapons are thrown from the audience.

Bill Walsh College Football is a Super NES, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and Sega [Mega-]CD American football game which was one of the first ones to deal with the sport at a college level. Except for Super Play Action Football, no game has ever dealt with football at a more simple level than college since that time. The plays are simpler, the rules are more complex, and football players are slightly smaller than their professional counterparts. During every good play, the audience cheers the player on. During a bad play, the same digital audience gives the player catcalls.

The game featured 25 college teams from the 1992 season and 25 historical teams. Pitt '80, Auburn '83, Florida '84, Brigham Young University Provo' 84, Texas '81, and Notre Dame '88 were prominent historical teams featured in the game.

One of the only College Football games to feature a choice between Bowl games or Playoffs.

It's the year GC 232 (Galaxy Century Year 232). A huge war that had begun years and years before has divided the Milky Way and all of its natural resources have been exhausted. The Milky Way Galactic Council is forced to send a fleet of starships to a nearby planet by the name of UP457 in search of any resources that can replenish the ones lost during the battle. However, during this mission, the fleet is destroyed by a race of half machine, half animal aliens referred to as "BIOMETAL" by the Galactic Council. One of the Council's super computers then calculates that the number of these "BIOMETALS" is increasing rapidly and will have the Milky Way completely taken over within 32 hours. So the Halbard's crew, young pilot Kid Ray and biologist Anita, along with their fleet, WASP, are assigned to eliminate the hostile threat on UP457.

Weapon power-ups are gained by destroying pods and picking up the released power-ups, which cycle through the various weapon types as in Raiden. Some weapons cancel each other out. The player also has a shield in the form of four spinning orbs that circle around the ship when the engaged. Charge power is drained when the shield is active. The shield can be used as protection against enemy fire.

The graphics have Giger-esque quality, which was a popular style during the late 80's/early 90's. The in-game effects use a lot of mode-7 raster effects and some impressive parallax scrolling.

Blackthorne
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Blizzard Entertainment
Publisher: Interplay
Players: 1
_________________________
*
In this side-scrolling adventure, you are Kyle Blackthorne, an ex-Marine mercenary with a mysterious past. When Blackthorne discovers that he is in fact a prince from another world, he sets out, armed only with a shotgun and nerves of steel, to liberate his home nation, defeat the invader Sarlac, and avenge his father's murder!

Blackthorne is a great game to play just for fun. It is also surprisingly sophisticated in terms of its graphics, sound, and storyline. The characters and backgrounds are very well-rendered, the animation is smooth and realistic. The music is pleasantly subdued so as not to become annoying, and the sound effects are right on.

Directions:

Gameplay is rich enough to be challenging without becoming too complex to enjoy. Most of the controls have two different functions according to whether or not your gun is drawn. This can lead to some unfortunate circumstances if you aren't careful, but for the most part it adds interest and realism, while many games that have tried to add complicated controls are just a nuisance.

Controls:

A Button - Draw or Holster Weapon
B Button - Jump, Fire
X Button - Use Item from Inventory
Y Button - Run, Fire Backward
Up - Dodge, Climb Ledge, Use Key
Down - Crouch, Pick up Items, Climb Down
L Button - Scroll through Inventory
R Button - Scroll through Inventory
Start Button - Start, Pause
Select Button - Display Inventory

Hints:

Dodging actions
You can avoid most attacks by pressing Up to 'hide' or dodge, so it's a good way to preserve life. Also, you can do some useful things while dodging, like using potions. While hiding with your gun drawn, press the fire button without releasing the Up button, to fire and quickly return to hiding. However, you can't draw your gun while hidden.

BlaZeon: The Bio-Cyborg Challenge
Platform: Super NES

Genre: Shoot 'em Up , Side-Scrolling , Sci-Fi
Release Year: 1992
Developer: AI
Publisher: Atlus
_________________________

A united space force known as the Imperial Earth Army was launched past the Solar System. When the Imperial Earth Army returned, it came armed with large, living robots known as Bio-Cyborgs that it used to dominate and oppress the societies of Earth. Players assume the role of a rebel forces pilot who has launched a surprise attack against the oppressive Imperial Earth Army, armed with a recently developed weapon capable of controlling the Bio-Cyborgs.

The player is set in control of The Garland TFF-01, a sub-standard space fighter ship that is only armed with a semi-auto or rapid fire laser gun known as the Beam Vulcan and the Tranquilander. Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player's Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, agilities and special attacks.

There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected. Extends/1 Ups were awarded every 300,000 points.

Bobby's World
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (USA)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Action , Side-Scrolling
_________________________
*
This game is still under debate whether it was released or not. The game was competed, there is no doubt about it, and the rom image was dumped. The game was being released by a company called Hi Tech. It was being planned for release in early 1995.

This game is based on the Howie Mandell cartoon of the same name. The story is that Bobby has to clean his room, and he has daydreams when he starts cleaning certain parts of his room. I decided to play this game until I got bored, and I ended up passing it, so here is a full review.

Graphics: 6/10

The graphics are ok, nothing that hasn't been seen on other snes games. The characters probably could have had more frames of animation, but there is a wide range of stages and enemies.

Sound: 5/10

Pretty bland. The music won't drive you crazy, but it is nothing special. The sound effects are also pretty plain, just appropriate, nothing more.

Controls: 4/10

The controls aren't that great. Bobby moves very slowly, and doesn't automatically respond to button presses.

At one spot, you must swing from these three logs. This is the hardest part of the game, only because of the controls. I died maybe 3 times in this game, except for this point, where I died around 20 times (luckily I got pissed off after the first few deaths and used savestates). Nothing is more evil that deaths caused by poor controls.

Overall Score: 4/10

I played this game for about 40 minutes and I passed it. If it weren't for that stupid spot aforementioned above, this game offers little challenge. Part of the problem is that there were life power ups usually placed just in the spot where you are near death. It is nice that there is a bit of variety (every third stage or so it changes from a side scroller to a shooter type of game), but it was certainly made with children in mind. There were 3 bosses, but they were easily vanquished by staying in the top corner where they couldn't hit you (they all moved in the same pattern). I don't know if this would even satisfy fans of the show (if they exist). But any game that lasts only 40 minutes with no replay value doesn't really warrant release, and in this case, it seems that it didn't.

will be silver and shoot out a red ball, and you will unlock 2 modes: 'Special' and 'Survival'.  
If you get a perfect 10, 000 on the Normal game, the Bomberman on the title screen will be Gold.

Bonkers
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Action , Side-Scrolling
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
_________________________
*
"Stupid cat..."

Disney's Bonkers is not a very good game. I'll tell you that right now. It was never a well heard of game, and it never will be because the Super Nintendo has basically died. (Although it's still the best in my opinion ^_^) I'm not surprised at that fact, either. Most games that are well heard of are usually pretty good, with those few exceptions. This game isn't very good. While the graphics aren't horrible, the gameplay is not very original, and it's repetitive and boring. Not to mention the horrible control.

Graphics: 6/10
Well, I've seen worse. But I've definitely seen much better, too. At my first glance they looked really good, but they're lacking some detail that can easily be put in. Animation was not bad at all, either. Some nice animation always pops up here and there. For instance, when you stand in one place not moving for a while, then Bonkers, the cat-like main character looks at you and grabs his ears and stretches them. Dashing looks pretty good, too. Overall, there are some okay graphics, which Capcom could have made better very easily. Maybe they were just lazy...

Audio: 1/10
God, I never want to hear that annoying music ever again. This song has one single solitary track. That's right, you hear the same track over and over in every single level. And to put it bluntly, that track sucks. I never liked it from the first second I heard it, I still hate it, and I'm not going to like it anytime soon. After the first level, I just started to get a bit annoyed. By the time I finished two more levels, I was beyond annoyed. But by that time, I usually had the volume all the way down so that I wouldn't have to listen to that God-awful music anymore. *shiver*

The sound wasn't impressive either. The only sounds I remember hearing are the sound of a balloon popping, Bonker's "Ouch!", and a little Shwing kind of sound when Bonkers dashes. (^_^) The balloon popping sound wasn't impressive at all, as it sounded rather scratchy to me and it didn't really sound too much like a balloon pop altogether. The other sounds weren't any better. When Bonker's says "Ouch!", it's not too bad at first, but you'll be hearing it way too often. After all, this game is pretty challenging, so you'll be getting hit at every corner. And I think you're smart enough to figure out that you hear his cry of pain at every corner as well. And then there's that dashing sound. As I mentioned, it makes a shwing kind of a sound. The most irritating thing to me about this was that it was very high pitched. It kind of hurts your ears. Nyuk!

Gameplay: 3/10
There isn't anything that's radically different from every game you've ever played. It's a side scrolling game, so of course you have views in front of and behind you. There are some features, though. First off, the dashing feature is probably the biggest part of the gameplay, although it's not very big. There is an unnecessarily large meter at the bottom left corner of the screen that fills up slowly. When it fills up, you can press Y and hold the directional pad in the direction you want to dash in. This can be used to pop balloons or simply go faster. The balloons found all over the level can be popped and sometimes hold some things in them. For instance, when you find a red potion in a balloon and take it, Bonkers goes bonkers and turns red. When he's red, he dashes non-stop in any direction of your choice until your allotted time runs out. But these balloons usually hold police badges. 

Police badges are found everywhere all over a level. When you get ten of these badges, you can restore a heart. (In case you didn't get the hint, the amount of hearts is your life meter.) This is actually a very good thing, because you'll be needing lots of hearts, and badges come in groups all the time. It's really easy to get these badges, so you should always grab them.

- Challenge: Fairly High
Yeah, this game is hard. I found the first couple of levels pretty easy, but it gets much harder as it goes on. The enemies are unlimited. If a dog runs up to you and you stomp that mutt to shut it up, another one comes to you in a matter of seconds. They're all over the place! Not to mention the fact that you have to avoid a million little obstacles that seem so big while you're dealing with three bees flying over your head, 2 bulldogs trying to gnaw on your butt, and some walking candlesticks burning you into some ashes.

- Control: Bad
The control was seriously messed up. I found the controls to be very unresponsive. I seriously needed to press each button twice just to have that stupid cat jump in the air. This leads to some serious frustration. I honestly found myself yelling at the screen because I kept falling into some bad places, thus making me lose several times, and therefore I get very aggravated and yell at the screen.

- Replay Value: Low
I really don't feel that playing this game again is necessary. I didn't enjoy it the first time, and I can't see why playing it through a second time would make me enjoy it any more. I am not aware of any special levels, codes, etc. that are unlocked when you complete it, either. If there was, it might be worth playing to unlock them. But there isn't, and that's the end of story.

Final Word
Bonkers is not a game that I would recommend. I'm a big fan of the SNES and have played a ton of SNES games, and I can safely say that this doesn't come anywhere close to the top ones. It's much closer to the bottom. Try it only if you're bored, or are just dying to play another 16-bit game.

Final Score: 3/10

What are you, digging for gold? How many of you have heard this when trying to manually clean your sinuses. Who knew that if you kept it up as much as this man, you'd become a Super-Hero. It snot what you think, though. You've been enlisted to find out where all the pollution is coming from, and you must use your mucus and flatulence to battle your way to its source. Good Luck and Pick Freely, my friend.

This game is full of "interesting" if not disgusting graphics that will have you blowing your nose if not playing for hours. Along with funny but gripping music, it makes this game a rather fun way of passing the time.

Directions:

In this drippy game, you must run through 20 levels, such as Flatulant Swamp, The Pits, Mucus Mountain, and Boogerville, and fight 4 bosses and 20 minions, such as Hick Boy, Revolta, and Deoder Ant, to get to the final level where you face off against The Booger Meister. Your weapons in this quest are simple: your boogers, gas, and a butt slam.

Don't forget, there is no defense other than not getting hit, and you can only get hit three times before you die. The color of your cape shows how much life you have left (yellow is bad). Also, within each level are a series of items that you need to collect, such as capes (which restore your health), plungers, and goop puddles which, at the end of each level will give you an extra life if you've collected enough. So without further adieu, turn on your computer, log-in to Console Classix, pick your nose, and play away. Have Fun, Gamer!

Boxing Legends of the Ring

Genre: Sports , Boxing
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Sculptured Software
Publisher: Electro Brain
_________________________
*
During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).

The fighters' movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.

There are three different modes: 'exhibition', 'career', and 'battle of the legends'. In 'exhibition' mode, a player can choose to fight as any boxer in the game, against any boxer in the game, against either the console or another player. In 'career' mode, a player creates their own boxer, and fights their way through all the boxers in the game, before fighting for the world title. If the player loses once in 'career' mode, he is given a warning that 'game over' would be given for the second loss; giving the player no alternative but to either use a password or start over again with a new boxer.

Each fight is seen from behind and slightly to one side of one of the boxers, so that the player appears to be looking over their shoulder, in the direction of their opponent. In the North American version, the blood is colored red while the Japanese version uses sweat instead. This is contrary to Nintendo's then-current censorship policy that blood should never be used in their games. Between each round, girls in bikinis announce the next round by showing a number around the ring (and to the player).

"A REAL Captain Tsubasa game"

Introduction

As you may know this game is based in a famous japanese anime/manga called Captain Tsubasa, which is about a boy who loves playing soccer more than anything in is life. So, this games will be a sequel for Captain Tsubasa 3 and 4, also on SNES, which means that it will be a soccer/RPG game. What does this mean? You'll play across a story with some players, but they level up like in RPG, making their stats better or learning new techniques.

Gameplay

Well, this time the gameplay has changed a little, since you will be confronted with a fifa-like game, which means that you'll see and control a player in a real soccer field and you will be able to control his movements, choosing when to perform their specials. Yeah, since one of the most interesting things on captain tsubasa games are the ability to choose between a wide set of special movements that some characters have. For example, Hyuga Kojir?, one of Japanese star players, has shots that are even able to take the opponent goalkeeper away. There is a team that has a dribble combination that uses every of their players and, as for the legendary Ozora Tsubasa, he has multiple special techniques that make him, once again, the best player in this game.

Story

This game's story is quite simple, since you are controlling a set of players whose only dream is to win the World Cup. You'll start by a introduction match with San Paulo FC, then you'll play with the amazing Ozora Tsubasa (now playing on the Calcio League), meeting his old friends and rivals, at a certain point you'll get to play in the Japan National Team, ''maybe'' taking them to the finals on World Cup. There are also special matches that have something to do with the main story but they can be played as some extra matches, for having even more fun playing this game.

Graphics/Sound

Graphics were greatly improved since the previous versions of Captain Tsubasa games, you now play in a real soccer field (like in FIFA games) but you'll be able to see small but REALLY GOOD special sequences when using the characters specials or in other important times (like when a goalkeeper punches a Tsubasa's Drive Shot). As for the sound, now you can even listen to some characters voices in special occasions, but if you use any technique of Tsubasa, Hyuga, Schneider or Wakashimazu you'll surely heard them. The music in each level is also good, just listen to it on the final stage and you will surely be amazed with its beauty.

Play Time/Replayability

One of the greatest things in this game is the time it is required in order to finish it. It is very long, difficult even for more good players. Also, you have a large set of extra functions to unlock, like lots of small stories with all the main characters (Misaki, Hyuga, Matsuyama, and so on...), 4 special matches against really good teams and many other surprises.

Final Recommendation

You must surely buy this game, it is the best Captain Tsubasa game ever and one of the best Super Nintendo games you'll ever see. Great graphics and sound, interesting story and an easy to understand game system make him surely a game you must surely have.

_________________________

Long ago, when you were just a boy, your father told you the story about the dragon. You loved that story, but little did you know that it was true, and that you yourself are a descendant of the Dragon Warriors. Your father left to seek out the last known dragon and was never heard from again. Now years later, you start your search for your father and the dragon he sought. This journey will take you through a world filled with Monsters, Fairies, and brain-straining puzzles. Arm yourself with sword, axe and shield, and carve your way into the history books. Good Luck.

Brain Lord is a fun game with a Legend of Zelda feel to it. The graphics are good, with awesome magical effects and backgrounds. The music is awesome and keeps the mood of the game. The gameplay in this game is very riveting, and if you like games like Lufia and Legend of Zelda then you will love this game. Brain Lord, in my opinion, is a must-play.

Directions:

Brain Lord is a fun adventure / rpg / puzzle game that takes you through three cities and four dungeons. This game is much like Lufia and Final Fantasy with the way you play it, however it is real-time combat, much like Zelda.

You begin this tale in the city of Arcs where you meet many of the characters that will aid you along the way (however, none of these characters join you, they just help with puzzles and give you advice at times).

Although this game is a progressive adventure with no real "levels," there are dungeons within this game much like Legend of Zelda, and they are the Tower of Light, the Ancient Ruins, the Ice Cave, and the Platinum Shrine. After fighting your way past goblins, skeletons and a multitude of traps, and after solving the many puzzles within the dungeons, you will be faced with a boss.

The bosses are all large creatures (save one) and have a pattern to their movements which can be used to kill them. The bosses are the Giant Beetle, the Gravity machine, Ramus (several character-sized ghosts that fly around you), and the Demon King.

Along the way, you will pick up or buy several items that you can use. Weapons such as swords and axes range from copper (being the weakest) to gold (being the strongest). Armor such as body and helms range from leather to gold. Shields are made of wood up to gold. You will also find other items such as food and hearts which refill and raise hit points, warp gates that take you back to the city, herbs that cure poison and disease, and red or blue vials which raise your damage or defense for a short period of time. Jade crystals that you find hold fairies, who act as secondary members of your party. They can level up and attack with different magical attacks such as fireballs, water bullets, and lightning. Little blue orbs that are dropped by dead enemies raise your fairies' experience and levels.

All of these items can be accessed within the menu, along with magic spells that you acquire such as Magic Shot and Missile to name a few. Also in the menu you can change the configuration of the game and check you character's status. All in all this is a fun game and I highly recommend it. So sit down, log in, and have fun!

On the third floor there is a large room with platforms and empty areas. One of the knights in the room drops a

In the black of night he stalks his unwitting victims with the passion of a prince and the grace of a wild animal. Able to assume the guise of everything from a shadow on the wall to a jagged-tooth wolf beast, he feeds on the living, sinking his pearly fangs into the fair throats for a drink of their life-giving serum.

A long time ago, a small kingdom called Berimya was built around a lofty tower, which pierced the sky. The inhabitants of the city, guarded by a mighty Dragon, lived in peace and abundance. However, King Berebus, the ruler of Berimya, desired to expand his kingdom. He ordered the scholars to research the Tower.

Soon, one of the scholars brought a tome written in an ancient language from the tower to Berebus, which they started deciphering. As they were deciphering the tome, some scholars feared that they might be laying their hands on the forbidden knowledge of the ancients.

When the scholars decipher the tome, it read, "The Great Guardian of Berimya, the Dragon, and the Essence of Power lies in the top of the Tower; the one who possesses the Essence will possess all." Undaunted by the otherwise ominous words of the tome, Berebus decided to make the Essence of Power his own.

He secretly organized an army, which soon seized the Tower and raised their swords against the Dragon. Even the Dragon could not resist the power of Berebus' army. As Berebus grasped at the Essence of Power, the Dragon gave up its own life to destroy the Essence of Power. The Essence, losing control, transformed the King into a hideous monster and sank the entire kingdom of Berimya, including the great tower, under the ground. All people on the surface of the earth forgot about Berimya and the Tower in its center, and a thousand years passed.

A mysterious swordsman, known as Varik, is pursued by a sorceress named Alexis (Dela Delon in Japan) who seeks revenge for the murder of her master. When Alexis catches up with Varik and attacks, her magic causes the ground beneath them collapsed and both fell into the Ruins of Berimya. The player assumes the role of Varik and must escape from the sunken city.

Reception:

The Super NES version isn't very well known or popular because of its late release, when the SNES market was beginning to fade off in anticipation of the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. Also, the game was published by Koei, which was known at the time for their strategic war games and not many RPG nor any action games. Another problem was the core gameplay, which affected all versions: The game plays in a top-down view and the controls are very tricky. When the default buttons are chosen, Varik moves without turning in another direction (strafe) unless the directions are pressed in combination with the rotate buttons, and when he rotates, the screen also does, which can easily confuse newcomers.

Tips:

Alternate Ending
Instead of helping Alexis fight him for an alternate ending.

Refill your Health
For an easy health refill: tap L + R at the same time-the screen will go black and your HP will slowly refill.

As in Final Fight, the player has to walk sideways and fight bad guys for several stages. Next to the general food-health supplies, the player can also pick up weapons like sticks, guns, grenades and such. A special Angry Mode gives injured fighters a burst of energy. You choose one of five characters Hack the street brawler, Slash the police officer, Lord J the karate master, Kazan the ninja, and, Wendy the professional wrestler. The game was followed by the release of The Peace Keepers.

This game is unique in the sense that this is the only Super NES game that has both the American and Japanese versions coded in the same cartridge, similar to some Sega Mega Drive or Sega Master System carts. Unlike those carts, however, the Japanese version can be accessed by a code. When the Jaleco logo appears, it can be accessed by pressing repeatedly B, A, X, Y in that order. Then, it will appear a glitchy screen resembling the game title. Just enter the options screen and exit. The Japanese title (Rushing Beat Ran) will appear. The difference between this and the American versions are the characters names, one of the character's attacks (a groin kick instead of a trip) and the lack of maze-like stages.

Tips:

Fight as the same exact character
Highlight the character and press Y at the same time

Title Screen Tricks
At the Jaleco logo, press B, A, X, Y repeatedly, at the sword slash press Start, as the screen changes press

As it says, it's from the guy who created Tetris. It's a puzzler involving blocks of different colors. Your goal is to eliminate blocks by taking out groups of two or more matching squares.

The graphics aren't great, but hey, when you love a puzzler you don't mind. The music makes me think of Buster Keaton for some reason.... oh well.

Directions:

Move your cursor to the block you wish to make disappear and press B. Only sets of at least two of the same color will disappear. Remove smaller sets from between bigger ones to get larger groups of the same color, then make the whole thing vanish.

If you press down and A you will drop the blocks (and dynamite sticks and various other items) that are floating across the top of the screen down onto your blocks.

Using X allows you to shift the blocks from one side to the other, if you have made a space all the way down to the bottom. When you eliminate all the blocks in a column, the blocks will pull themselves together to close off the space if it's in the middle. Now you have an empty space on the end to move the blocks left or right.

Drop the blocks overhead when colors match up or when special items will benefit you most. The block that is split into four different colors that keep changing will allow you to get rid of all of a specific color. To do this, move the cursor over to this block and press B. When the screen has a yellow border, you can now move the cursor to a color of your choice and press B again. All the blocks that are that color will disappear. Dynamite is the most common special block. When you drop one stick on another they will explode and take some of the blocks around them with them. Also, when dynamite is resting on the bottom of the screen you may select it at any time to make it explode.

Press B on a block that has a flashing arrow on it and it will turn into a rocket and shoot across the screen in whichever direction the arrow was facing and take out all of the blocks in its path!

The flashing blue and yellow blocks that are on your board (in later levels) can only be eliminated by special blocks. Try to get rid of most of the other blocks first, that makes it easier to make sure that the special items will be where you need them to eliminate these blocks. 

Controls:

A Button - Drops blocks while pressing down
B Button - Knock out blocks
X Button - Shift Blocks
Y Button - Guiding lines On/Off
Start Button - Begin game/ Pause

Hints:

Plan Things Out
Sure, you could sit there and randomly press B all over the screen to make block sets disappear, but most of the time that will leave you with a mess at the bottom of the screen that is going to be harder to get rid of.

Strike Out the Colors
Once you've eliminated all blocks of one color on the playing board, that color will no longer bother you. No more blocks of that color will fall from the skies, so get rid of a color as soon as you can.

Drogen

After many years of peace, the Dark Dragons have amassed an army and have begun to take the land by force. The world needs a hero.

Camlon Castle

A band of ruthless monsters have descended upon Camlon Castle. As the hero of the Light Dragon Clan, you are the only hope for the kingdom. It is up to you to enter the castle and do away with the offending beasts.

Nanai

A series of earthquakes is rocking the world. Travel to Nanai by night and stop the quakes by shutting off an earth-shaking machine in the town's underground.

--From the SNES Breath of Fire instruction manual.

Overview:

Breath of fire was another great RPG by Squaresoft. Squaresoft had some of the best RPG's in classic gaming history. The graphics were bright, colorful and well drawn. The sounds effects were good and the music was catchy. After playing this game for a little while, you may find yourself humming the songs. The gameplay was awesome, leaving room to make different choices during next game, thus providing a new experience. The controls are easy to use since mostly you'll be thumbing through menus. Breath of Fire is definitely a must play for anyone who enjoys the RPG genre.

Directions:

Breath of Fire consists of four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen.[3] The overworld is a scaled-down, simplified version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to navigate between various locations. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered while traveling though field maps or on the overworld. As the player commands the lead character to move, the other members of the traveling follow in a line behind him/her. The order of the group line can be changed at any time, allowing another character to take the lead. Most playable characters display a unique field skill outside of battle, which can only be accessed by placing them at the front. Some areas cannot be entered unless a certain character has joined; for example, the party cannot walk through forests unless Bo is at the head of the group.
The color palette of field maps changes depending on the time of day. Whenever the traveling party appears on the overworld screen, the sun rises and sets with each passing minute of real time. Non-player characters can be found milling about inside towns at daytime, whereas they will retire to their homes at night and early morning. In certain instances, the player must wait until nightfall before they can enter a given town.
The game's story develops as the player visits towns and dungeons. Townspeople offer helpful information, and some residents own item or equipment shops. Since the player's inventory space is limited, most item shops double as banks which offer to hold spare items or GP (the game's currency). Dungeons primarily appear in the form of castles, caves, and towers. Towers consist of several floors, often composed of puzzles or mazes, further complicating the party's task of reaching the top.
The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.
Fishing and hunting play a small role in Breath of Fire's gameplay. By outfitting Ryu with a rod and bait, the player can fish at designated spots on the overworld, often nabbing rare equipment in the process. Birds, wild boar, and deer randomly appear on the overworld. If Bo is leading the group, he can hunt animals by firing arrows at them. Once struck, the animal will change into an item (Meat) which can be then picked up. Certain types of meat restore Health Points (HP), while others refill Ability Points (AP).

Combat

During its turn-based fight sequences, Breath of Fire switches to a 3/4 perspective. Up to four characters may participate in a battle, though each can be swapped out for another party member if the player so chooses. The battle screen is a detailed representation of whatever area the party is currently in, such as a desert or grassland. Although characters are miniaturized on maps, in combat their sprites are normal-sized and more realistic.

A maximum of four characters may participate in battles, although each can be swapped out for another party member at any time. Each character acts in an order dependent on their individual statistics. Players are rewarded for winning battles with experience points and GP. When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. Each party member has the option to attack, cast a magic spell, use a restorative item, or escape the fight by running away. The party can also be placed under automatic control, causing them to attack without the player's input.

The Hit Points and Ability Points of each party member is visible via a HUD at the bottom of the screen. Enemies' HP remains unseen, though a life bar measuring an enemy's health will appear whenever a foe takes damage. An identical display appears during boss battles, but in this case, the life bar is misleading; the bar very often will drop to zero, only to see the boss acquire a second wind and continue to attack without any visible HP.

At the beginning of the game, Ryu is powerless except for his sword-fighting skill. He can awaken his innate powers by visiting small, isolated shrines on the overworld known as Dragon Temples. After accepting a challenge from the monk inside, Ryu is separated from the rest of his party and pitted in a one-on-one battle against a dragon. If he wins, Ryu earns the ability to morph into various dragons during battles. Whenever this occurs Ryu's sprite is replaced with a dragon, and the strength of his attacks increases.

Karn is another character who can change forms. Hidden throughout the game are four members of an ancient clan who claim to Karn's blood relatives. Each clansman enables Karn to change into powerful mutant creatures by "Fusing" together with Bo, Ox, and Gobi. Although this removes the fused characters from the party roster, it also grants Karn a boost in HP and overall strength. Unlike Ryu, Karn stays in his fused state outside of battle, and will remain so until the player commands him to revert back. 

Controls:

A Button - Action
B Button - Back up a step in Command screens
Start Button - Map
Select Button - Command Screen

Hints:

9999 experience and 9999 gold
Before battling Jade in Obelisk, he will ask you if you want to join him. Answer "Yes", and whenever he asks you if you want to change your mind, answer "No". Do not push any buttons and he will soon say, "I'm bored. Entertain me!" After this, there will be a battle scene. You will fight a D.Flea, a Crab, a Flower, a G.Slime, and finally an M.Slime which, when defeated, will give you 9999 experience and 9999 gold.

Tips:

Chun-Li in Breath of Fire
To see a cameo of Chun-Li from Street Fighter, go to the town Bleak. Go to the magician kid's house and talk
to him. He will say to put 100 GP on the table and he will make them disappear. When he asks you this, say 'yes. ' When he says 'look behind you' say 'no' twice then yes. It'll show Chun-Li in a room doing her famous 'Lightning Kick. '

Breath of Fire II
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Players: 1
_________________________
*
The fictional world of Breath of Fire II is very reminiscent of the previous game, though very few locations have endured the 500-year transition. Windia, home to the royal Wing Clan, still resides to the north. The island of Tunlan, home to a people who communicate entirely though flute-playing, also makes a return. New species include the Shell Clan, a race of giant armadillos, and the Creeping Clan, a monarchy of artisan frogs. The Dragon Clan from Breath of Fire has all but perished, leaving only scattered statues as proof of their existence. Somehow, Karn (a standard human) and Bo (a Forest Clan member), two playable characters from the original game, have endured the 500 years and now live in a hut on a secluded island.

A new religious idol named St. Eva has replaced the Dragon God, and the St. Eva church is rapidly becoming popular all over. Unbeknown to its followers, the church is actually a front for demons in order to channel the people's prayers into energy and send it to their master, Deathevn.

Long ago, a demon attacked the woodland town of Gate. According to local legend, a huge dragon suddenly appeared and banished the demon away. The dragon can still be found slumbering on the outskirts of Gate, where it guards the entrance to the demon realm.

Gameplay:

Of the five games in the series, Breath of Fire II bears the most similarities to the original entry. Like Breath of Fire, the game consists of four modes of play: the world map, the field map, a menu screen, and a battle screen. The world map is seen through an aerial view display in which players navigate across a small-scale version of the game world. As the player character moves around, other members of his traveling party walk behind them in a line. The group's lineup can be rearranged at any time, allowing another character to become leader. Every character has a unique skill that is used outside of battle; depending on who is currently leading the group, the player can use these skills to fish, hunt animals, bridge chasms, or swim across water.

As in the previous game, the color palette of outdoor areas and towns changes depending on the time of day. Whenever the overworld screen appears, the sun rises and sets with each minute of real time. Non-player characters are found milling about inside towns at daytime, whereas they retire to their homes at night and early morning.

Fishing and hunting once again play a role in the game, this time as short minigames. Hunting areas (indicated by tufts of grass) randomly spawn on the world map.[4] These spots transport the party to a small forest that is populated by animals. Very few characters have the ability to hunt; Bow comes equipped with a crossbow, while Katt attacks with her staff. Depending on their size, animals take anywhere from 1-10 hits to defeat, whereupon they transform into a restorative item.

Fishing spots (indicated by a leaping fish) behave in a similar manner, with the exception that they always respawn in the same location. During these sequences, the game switches to a side-view camera angle of Ryu standing over a coral reef. Ryu must be outfitted with a rod and a lure before he can catch fish. A on-screen gauge measures the strength of Ryu's fishing line; if a fish bites the lure, the Tension meter steadily rises until Ryu reels in the fish. If the meter reaches maximum, the line snaps and the fish goes free. Additionally, it is possible to hook a Manillo salesman (a recurring species in Breath of Fire) by replacing bait with Gold as a lure. The Manillo then offers to sell his wares, which often includes equipment from areas that Ryu has not visited yet.

Breath of Fire II introduces the gameplay element of building a town, soon to be revisited in later entries. At a mid-way point in the game, Ryu is given a choice between distinct style of houses to build, including standard two-story houses, wooden cottages on stilts, and Arabian-style dwellings. As the town expands, players are allowed to seek out potential occupants who are scattered throughout the game. Some of these characters perform a restorative function, while others set up taverns or shops.

Tips:

Old Friends
At Giant Island, in the northern area of the map above the town Gate (Press select for the map), you'll find
Bo and Karn from the first Breath of Fire game.  They don't do anything though, but you can talk to
them. You'll need the whale or the bird to get there though.

Infinite Healing Items or Gold Coins
After you have the carpenter build the house for the old lady that unites shamans, go to the northeastern
house where the carpenter cooks. Talk to the carpenter and he'll tell you he can cook anything. In the item selection screen use two herbs to make a HelpBL four to make an Elixer. Now to make it infinte, next use either four HelpBL's or two elixers to make a LifePL. So that would mean that you used 8 hervs. for a total of 64gp to make one LifePL for a total of 250gp. So sell your LifePL's to make alot of money, buy more herbs and do it again!

Breath of Fire 2's translation is infamously terrible. From "Yes" and "No" being swapped to the game asking you to equip a fishing lod and bait, the writing in the game is bad even by Capcom's low standards. The game itself is supposed to have a really interesting plot, but the text deteriorates to a point towards the end that nobody can really make any sense of what's going on.

That said, it's not a bad game. The dragon spells are pretty useless, unfortunately, but the rest of it is fairly standard RPG fare. The music's decent, the graphics are good, and the game's fairly tough, but if the meat of an RPG is the story, this one's so stringy and tough that it drowns out just about everything else. Hopefully the current translation project will correct this.

Translation Description:

This is the long-awaited English version of d4s' Breath of Fire 2 retranslation/enhancement patch, two-and-a-half years in the making.

The Absolute Definitive Object Of The Game

To complete the game in a victorious manner, you must reach and then defeat Oinker P. Hamm. To locate Oinker, travel through all the levels of the selected tour in the Amazatorium, making sure to tag the end of level markers (large, red marbles) in each world. When all levels are completed, the boss door will open that leads you to Oinker.

These Items Are Important, Too!
The Amazatorium has three floors and two wings - East and West. Choosing one wing or the other will affect which sections you will venture through. Each wing is entirely different, complete with its own challenges. To put it technically, "It's like having two-two-Two Amazatoriums in One." Before making that all-important wing choice, you must choose a tour. The number of levels seen in the Amazatorium will depend on the type of tour you choose. Each tour increases with difficulty, ranging from the First Floor tour as the mildest, to the Grand Tour as the longest and most difficult.

The first Bubsy game was released in May 1993 by Accolade for the SNES, and later for the Genesis. The plot focuses on a race of fabric-stealing aliens called "Woolies", who have stolen the world's yarn ball supply (especially Bubsy's, who owns the world's largest collection). Naturally, Bubsy does not take too kindly to the theft and sets out to "humble" the Woolies.

The game features five main worlds with three levels in each, and a final level after completion of the first 15 levels. A password is given at the end of each world, which can be used to continue the game after getting a "game over". (In this game, "continues" are special items which must be found.)

There are several cartoon-like animations in the game. If Bubsy collides with a wall at high speed, he becomes disoriented with a comical bird effect appearing above his head -- this is one of only two "injuries" that doesn't kill him; the other is being frozen solid for a few seconds by an ice cream cone, which he then thaws from. After sliding down a water slide if the player does not press any buttons Bubsy will shake the water off himself leaving his fur frizzed up for a few seconds. The third world, which features a western desert theme, has similarities to a Wily E. Coyote/Roadrunner episode; Matt Berardo wrote the musical score. The voice samples (performed by John A. S. Skeel) were present in the Genesis version, but they were encoded in PCM, whereas the samples in the SNES version were encoded into individual SPC modules.

"What's up Doc?" Bugs Bunny, that carrot-chomping, "wascally wabbit" is searching out his nemesis who is constantly painting him into ever-changing corners. A lunatic animator is out to get Bugs, but little does he know that Bugs has an ACME arsenal at his command. He'll throw pies into the face of his enemy, use mirrors to deflect shrinking rays and paint skunk stripes on the backs of cats. There are many more tricks up this clever rabbit's sleeve. The animator throws Bugs into the middle of dangerous situations, each like a different cartoon. Bugs may find himself outsmarting hunting hounds in the forest with Elmer Fudd one moment and then find he is smack dab in the middle of a wrestling ring facing The Crusher the next. In the tenth and final level, discover the mad animator behind the chaos. Saturday mornings were never this crazy!

--From the SNES Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage instruction manual.

Tips:

Bulls vs Blazers and the NBA Playoffs
Platform: Super NES

Release Year: 1992
Developer: Electronic Arts
Publisher: EA Sports Network
_________________________

Bulls versus Blazers was a 1993 video game that was available for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Super Nintendo game consoles. The game was a sequel to the Bulls versus Lakers video game.

The game could be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two levels, "exhibition" or "playoffs". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that had gone to the playoffs in the NBA the year before the game was released. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters.

History:

 - It was the first EA basketball game to feature self in-game advertisements of the company's logo "EA Sports".

 - It was the first time custom fiction teams could be made. You could create fantasy matchups such as Drexler vs. Drexler. Or create an entire team roster duplicating the same player 12 times.

Hey, all you puzzle-playing game gurus-- it's time to blast some bubbles in Bust-A-Move! Follow the instructions below to get going on all the bubble-bursting action.

--From the SNES Bust-A-Move instruction manual.

Overview:

Bust-A-Move was also known as Puzzle Bobble, a reference to its stars, Bubby and Bobby, and their original appearance in the Bubble Bobble series of games. Bust-A-Move isn't much like those games, though. This is a puzzle game in which you try to eliminate different colored bubbles on the screen by getting at least three of the same color side by side. The idea of this relatively simple puzzle game has become extremely popular on the Internet recently, in many variations such as Dynomite, Pop and Drop, and that Snood game everybody was playing a while back.

Dr. Kiln, a character not in the game (but who is mentioned in the booklet, finally putting in an appearance in ClayFighter 63 1/3 for Nintendo 64) lands in a spacecraft and spreads goo from the meteor to create more fighters. He declares himself grand master of Mudville after the fall of N. Boss, the ending boss of the original ClayFighter. He holds the C-2 tournament to see which clayfighter can become next grandmaster of Mudville.

Cacoma Knight in Bizyland
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Strategy , Puzzle , Fantasy
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Seta
Publisher: Seta
_________________________
*
Cacoma Knight is a hybrid of action and puzzle elements. Each level is a single screen. The first image that the player sees is a landscape, for example, a forest or a town. The image will then fade into a "corrupt" version of the landscape, for example, the trees become rotten and buildings become ruined. Each screen has a "Qualify" target that shows how much of the screen must be cleared before the game continues to the next level. The player can then use the Magical Chalk to section off an area of the landscape, using either the borders of existing cleared sections or the borders of the screen. When a full shape is completed with no holes in its borders, the smaller of the two sections created is "purified" and returned to the original state shown at the beginning of the level. 

In the cleared section, there may be power-ups or items that increase the point score of the player. Therefore, a greater "% Cleared" score means more points and power-ups will be rewarded, so it is beneficial to the player to attempt to clear as much of the screen as possible before exceeding the Qualify target.

Enemies can impede progress of the player and come in various shapes, sizes and speeds. Some enemies can only move along the borders of the screen and the chalk lines that the player creates, others have free rein of the screen within given borders. Enemies can be destroyed by trapping them within an area of chalk, however, they will repopulate quickly thereafter. The player must avoid getting hit by enemies. If the player allows the character to get hit by the enemies too many times (based on the difficulty), they will be brought to a continue screen. Continuing costs one Credit, of which the player has a predetermined amount based on the difficulty that they are playing on. If the player runs out of the Credits, the game ends.

A visual measure of progress is implemented between rounds in the game (a round includes several landscapes that the player must complete). When a player completes a round, an incomplete image is shown which is slowly filled in as the player completes more and more rounds.

"At least it ends..."

Wow. This game made me want to smash my face through my SNES system repeatedly. You're this little dude and you do stereotypical California games.

Graphics 2/10

It's nothing special. There's some flat, uninteresting colors that help you tell one thing from another, but for the most part, the graphics aren't anything extraordinary. They don't hurt the game, but a hardcore graphics lover wouldn't be pleased.

Gameplay 1/10

Not fun at all. Like I said, you run around California doing some boring games. You can go hang-gliding, but all you do is fly out, pick up a few things and drift back to land. You could be done within 30 seconds. Then you can Jet-Ski, where you ride around a surprisingly complex track. However, there's no racing, just some obstacles. Then, somehow quickly getting from the ocean to the mountains, you go snowboarding. You ride down the hill and at one point hit a half pipe and do a trick or two while struggling to get out. Then you continue on and you get to a point without snow, which makes no sense to me. Then, you get to go skating in yet another long and winding track. And did I mention the ''commentary'' throughout all the events? Yeah. There's some ''dude'' who never talks, but little words appear above him. He spouts words like ''bogus'' or ''face plant'' if you do poorly. If you do well, he'll say something like ''totally'' or ''awesome''. 

Before every event, he'll say something like ''get ready to carve concrete'' or some other witty line. They all have do to with cutting for some reason, however.

Controls 2/10

Really awkward at some points but better at others. It'd be so much better if you didn't have to share a single controller for multiplayer.

Sound: 1/10

The music drives me nuts. It's a little, repeating ''guitar'' piece and then it keeps going...and going...and going until you turn the game off. You'd be happier with the sound down or off.

Buy or Rent?

If you have to do one of those, rent it. Otherwise stay the **** away from this game. You could pick it up in a bargain bin just for a laugh, but don't spend too much on this game, as you'll be sick of it in a few days.

Overall

I despised this game with all of my heart when I was younger. Now I can pop it in for a quick laugh, but the humor soon fades.

Cannon Fodder
Platform: Super NES
Region: Europe
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Shooter , Strategy , Third Person
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Sensible Software
Publisher: Virgin Interactive
_________________________
*
"An interestingly addictive mix of action and strategy."

If you enjoy strategic military games, but get angry when the game requires too much strategy, then Cannon Fodder is the perfect game for you. It's creative an there really isn't any other game like it. Leave no enemy standing! Shoot 'em until they STAY down!

Graphics: 7
The graphics are certainly unique, and manage to cram a whole bunch of color into the various levels, especially the tropical ones. The army men also look funny, and you may find yourself continuing to play just to see them scurrying along the map.

Music/Sound: 5
Music wise, there is almost nothing at all, save for the 5 second victory cheer and the title screen music. Sound effects are decent. Guns sound like guns. Dying soldiers sound as they should.

Story: 5
You're in the military. You have to successfully complete each of the 30+ missions that your commander throws at you. Quit your whining solider, you're a marine now!

Gameplay: 8
The basic premise of Cannon Fodder is quite simple. Aside from small mission objectives like destroying buildings and collecting bombs, the main idea is that you have to guide your tiny army men towards victory by annihilating the opposing army. Even though this may sound a bit tedious and monotonous, Cannon Fodder manages to be a lot of fun despite itself. Controlling soldiers is as easy as the SNES controller will allow it to be, and the men move fairly fluidly, and only occasionally get caught on a tree or the edge of a forest. The difficulty is directly proportional to how quickly your fingers can move, and direct the soldiers, because it often comes down to shooting here, then there, and then in the other direction again. The game is about 80% firefights with a bit of stealth and planning here and there. Occasionally you'll need to use some rockets, or a hovercraft to complete some slightly harder objectives such as taking out a base or gliding hastily through a muddy swamp. Being able to shoot the enemy soldiers an unlimited amount of times, each time sending them flying further backwards is another definite plus.

Buy/Rent: Although the game has a moderate amount of replay value, it isn't for everybody, so you'll want to rent it first to see what you think. I myself highly recommend giving these pint-sized, nitro-charged, heavy-hitting heroes a try. But make sure you show them victory, or they might revolt and use you for...well...Cannon Fodder.

"Road Rash on licensed bikes"

OPENING STATEMENT
Well, I have been meaning to write this review for a few months so I am glad to be finally getting on with it. Cannondale Cup is a rather blatant clone of EA's action racing game series. However, it improves upon the Road Rash series in almost all of the really important aspects. Wherever EA is, I hope they are taking notes for their next Road Rash installment on the PlayStation 2.

GAMEPLAY--8
The object of Cannondale Cup is to take one of Radical Entertainment's ten 'interesting' looking racers and put them to the ultimate test. You must race them through a race in which there are no consequences for any actions whatsoever. Cutting off other riders, punching or kicking them, or shoving them into oil slicks is all just part of the game.

So obviously Cannondale Cup is not a pure racing game, but winning the race is still the final objective in the game. You could knock all of the other riders off their bicycles ten times each race, but if one passes you at the end, you will still finish second. So you really should not overuse your skills as a violent biker. You should only use them as a tool to keep you ahead of the competition.

GRAPHICS--4
Cannondale Cup is certainly not a very impressive game graphically. The arenas and tracks especially look horrible. They basically have the feel of the racing environments from Super Mario Kart, except that the graphics are going for a realistic feel and they look like they were created three years earlier.

The riders do not look much better. Sure, in their still drawings, their portraits, they look fine, perhaps even good. But, not once they are in action. You know how the little pictures of your Pokemon, in the original Pokemon games, while they are in battle, look nothing like the Pokemon should? That is kind of how the bike riders, with their choppy animation and curious looks, look like when they are actually racing in Cannondale Cup.

MUSIC--8
SOUND--5
The music is rather good in Cannondale Cup. The early nineties had that odd grunge rock music, and Cannondale Cup certainly fits in with that style. Mountain biking was 'hip' then, so the music fits in all the better. Basically, the music's only goal is to get you revved up to punch some more riders out en route to the finish line.

The sound effects, sadly, are almost as bad as the horrible graphics. The voice acting, although it mainly consists of a few grunts and groans, is bad enough to make you gag. The atmospheric effects of tires squealing, bikes clanking, and the ground scraping against rims is almost nonexistent. Basically, Radical Entertainment could have made all of the sound effects sound just a bit more 'radical' by actually putting some effort into making them in the first place.

CONTROL--7
The control, surprisingly enough, worked a lot better than I thought it would. The buttons may not all carry out what you would expect them to, but it feels quite natural, and no important movements are really constrained. What really works well, though, is controlling both sides of punching and kicking other riders with 'L' and 'R,' and I am quite glad that Radical Entertainment came up with that set-up for Cannondale Cup. Basically, the control scheme works perfectly. Just, due to the horrible animation which really compromises the control in Cannondale Cup, your riders sometimes have some problems reacting to what you tell them to do, which significantly lowered the score in this category.

FUN--7
To me the mindless and repetitive action in Cannondale Cup was surprisingly fun. When I first played Road Rash, it was fun for a while, but then it just got boring. In Cannondale Cup, everything is not as advanced, so it is in turn even more repetitive, but I still had quite a bit of fun. The graphics may be nauseating, the sound effects make you want to deafen yourself, but somehow, crashing and banging your way through ten, or more, laps on a bike you chose out of many choices (I had to get that in somewhere.) against nine other odd-looking, and in some cases, flamboyant, characters is still fun. It is not something you can explain, just like you cannot explain love. (I ought to be shot for putting in that comparison. Well, not really, but, you know.) Basically, Cannondale Cup provides all of the mindless fun that you will need this side of Final Fight on your Super Nintendo.

CHALLENGE--LOW
Cannondale Cup is most certainly not a difficult game. On the first time I played Cannondale Cup, I did a ten lap race, and I finished first. I did not even have the slightest idea what the game or the controls were like before I started, but I still finished first. And it really was not even a close race. I knocked over my last competition in the eight lap. And, no, this section does not exist only for me to discuss my Cannondale Cup accomplishments. I just believe that using personal examples is the best way to relay any important information about a game's challenge.

REPLAY VALUE--MEDIUM TO HIGH
Chances are you will replay Cannondale Cup plenty of times. It will take you, literally, hundreds of thousands of laps, to unlock all of the races and levels, and you most certainly are not going to race all of those laps at once. No, you will probably spread out all of the laps over weeks and months, and every time you open a new circuit, a new race, it will be an accomplishment worth noting, and bragging to all of your game playing friends about. Perhaps you should not actually tell them and brag, but it is worth it of course! Basically, you will probably even play Cannondale Cup some after you have unlocked and mastered the final race to unlock.

PROS
*Grungy rock music goes well with feel of the game.
*Use of licensed bikes gives game a more realistic feel.
*Very high replay value makes purchasing the game more worthwhile.

CONS
*Horrible sound effects will make you want to destroy something.
*Graphical landscapes and characters are bleak and completely ugly.
*Challenge is very low, and veteran players will not find it difficult enough.

CLOSING STATEMENT
All in all, Cannondale Cup is a good mindless game. People that really are not 'hardcore gamers' (I really hate that phrase.) will adore Cannondale Cup because of it's mindlessness and 'extreme' feel. And the normal 'hardcore gamers' will like Cannondale Cup because of the fast action and the high replay value. It is a win-win situation.

OVERALL--7

The Avengers, the Earth's mightiest Heroes, have uncovered a plot by the evil RED SKULL to conquer the world by using his mind control machine on the Supervillains Whirlwind, Crossbones, Juggernaut, Mandrin, and the Grim Reaper. Defeat the supervillains and save the World! This action/adventure game is based on the MARVEL COMIC.

A fun and addicting comic game. Captain America and the Avengers has great SNES graphics, especially considering the release year, and the sound quality is decent. It can actually be considered music.

Directions:

First, pick one of the four Avengers: Captain America, Vision, Hawkeye, and the Iron Man. In gameplay, if your character dies, you can either revive your fallen Avenger or chose one of the other Avengers to continue where the other failed. But you can only do this if you have at least one life left. Guide your Avenger through each level, fighting robots, scuba divers, thugs, and Supervillains. Each Avenger has his own projectile attack and is better in different locations. Use CAP or Iron Man on the the first stage. They are better in hand-to-hand combat. If you are Captain America, to throw your shield press A button. If you are Iron Man, to shoot your energy beam press the A button. Use Hawkeye on the second stage, he is the best for long range fighting (To fire arrows press A). Use Vision on the under water level (energy beams press A). It doesn't matter who you use on the fourth stage. When fighting the Juggernaut, defeat him with your jump attacks. 

Use Captain America on the final level when fighting the Red Skull. Use your jump attacks (A + B) on him and watch out for the mines he sets to stop you.

Controls:

A Button - PROJECTILE ATTACK
B Button - JUMP
X Button - N/A
Y Button - PUNCH/KICK
L Button - BLOCK
R Button - BLOCK
Start Button - START, PAUSE

_________________________

It's the year 2026. The world is filled with crime. Captain Commando and his three faithful Commando Companions rise up to erase this crime from Planet Earth and from all the Galaxy. But the futuristic criminals they have to fight are endowed with a secret, hidden, evil power. Many of them are Super Criminals, with ability beyond that of ordinary mortals. The leader of all Super Criminals is Scumocide (known as Genocide in Japan).

The player chooses from the four members of the "Commando Team". The Commandos must fight their way through an army of genetically engineered super-criminals, traveling through a bank, a museum, and an aquarium, among other locations. Their quest eventually leads to an interplanetary journey to Callisto, where the evil mastermind "Scumocide" (known in the Japanese version as "Genocide") awaits.

Some main differences that stood out in this game at the time of its release were: the option to play with four players simultaneously, the ability to run and launch an attack (whether on the ground or an aerial one) for some distinct techniques, and mecha that the players can ride. The characters can add some variation in their combos by pressing forward during their attacks.

Captain Novolin is the only one who can stop the alien Blubberman and rescue the mayor of Pineville. He rides a speedboat and needs to avoid the alien invaders who have turned themselves into junk food while eating healthy meals to keep his blood glucose within a safe zone. Players earn bonus points by correctly answering multiple choice questions about diabetes (the correct answers of which are given at the beginning of levels). Novolin can stomp enemies by pressing down when he jumps, but this isn't immediately obvious, and some players find difficulty in avoiding many of the enemies.

Using the EDA (Enemy Detection Arrow), you can track down the enemy and find out where he is.  If the arrow is pointing north, the enemy is right in front of you.  If the arrow is pointing south, the enemy is right behind you.  Time to switch to your rear guns if this happens!  Looking at your opponents arrow may be cheating, but it is a key factor in telling you where he may be.  If your arrow and the enemy's arrow are both pointing north, get ready, because you are heading right for one another!  Plus, using the compass with the EDA can also help greatly.  If the enemy goes south, go north.  You'll meet him eventually.  In short, he goes one way, you go the opposite.

Developer: Konami

The setting: medieval Transylvania. Several hundred years have passed since legendary hero Simon Belmont defeated the evil Count Dracula and sealed him away for what was supposed to be eternity. The people have long forgotten about the horror of the undead, thus allowing a few depraved individuals to restore the Prince of Darkness to his former state; sleeping in his coffin by day and preying upon hapless victims by night.

Dracula now plans to get revenge on his old enemy through his descendants by locking Annet, the girlfriend of Belmont's great-grandson, Richter, and her sister, Maria, in his dark gloomy castle.

Once aware of this, Richter takes his ancestor's sacred whip, passed down through the years from father to son, and sets out for Dracula's castle to rescue Annet and Maria, and to seal away the evil Count for good.

--From the SNES Castlevania Dracula X instruction manual.

Overview:

Castlevania Dracula X was a great addition to the Castlevania series. The graphics were a great deal better than that of Castlevania 4. Most of the bosses are new and harder to beat. You get to go up against a werewolf, a huge knight with an equally large lance, and a two headed panther, forgoing the typical Medusa, Frankenstein, and Grim Reaper. I don't think this game is quite as difficult as the original Castlevania, but it is still quite hard to beat. I don't think I could have done it without cheating.

Unfortunately, for Dracula X they got rid of the special weapon having its own button, and the ability to throw your whip in any direction. For the special weapon, Konami went with the old "push up and attack at the same time" routine from the earlier games. The jump ability was improved, though. You can change directions in mid air this time, and you can jump onto and off of stairs. If you are in the mood for some good old Castlevania action, load up Castlevania Dracula X and have at it!

Directions:

This addition to the Castlevania series plays muck like its predecessors. It's a platformer that you must fight your way through, only to meet up with a boss at the end. After you defeat the boss, your life will be refilled and you will start the next level.

You start with three men and you may find one-ups in candles and secret blocks you can destroy with your whip.

Candles also may hold hearts. Hearts give you the ability to use your secondary weapon. A small heart gives you one and a large one gives you five. Candles can also contain a cross pendant that will destroy all enemies on the screen. Meat that restores life may also be found in candles. A key can also be found that will open one locked door. You may also find a potion that will make you invincible for a short period of time. A bag of money will give you some extra points.

All secondary weapons are found in candles also. The axe flies in an arc when thrown and costs one heart. The dagger throws three daggers straight ahead and costs one heart. The boomerang will go straight and come back to you and costs one heart. The holy water flies in an arc and causes a fire to spread on the floor when it breaks, and it costs three hearts to use. The stopwatch will freeze all enemies for a few seconds and costs five hearts. Whenever you pick up one of these weapons, the weapon you had before will be cast on the ground, and will remain there for a few seconds if you want to pick it back up. Everything that falls out of candles has a time limit, so if you don't grab it soon it will disappear. 

Controls:

A Button - None
B Button - Jump
X Button - Item Crash
Y Button - Whip
Start Button - Start/Pause
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Fighting Tip
To avoid being thrown back into a pit or other object while fighting any enemy, duck when your character is hit. This will not work if a whip is being used, or when on a spinning gear (clock tower). This is very useful for fighting Dracula when he uses his huge double fire ball attacks.

Tips:

At the password screen, simply change the bottom right fire to an axe. Last stage with best ending

Extra 1-ups
To get an extra 1-up, beat each stage without getting hit. If you come out unscathed (no, you cannot get hit

The Key's Secret
After collecting the Key item which goes into your sub-weapon box in Stage 3, if you have 15 hearts or
more, use the Item Crash button. While to most people it seems to do nothing more than make a question mark
appear over your head, if the key itself makes contact with an enemy or boss during this brief
animation, they'll sustain heavy damage. The best part of this secret is while you must have 15 hearts or more
to enable the item crash, actually using it consumes ZERO hearts allowing the attack to be used continuously! It also has the highest attack power killing most enemies in a single hit even if used regularly as well (Up + Attack) and once again consumes no hearts however to balance it's attack power, it's also the closest range 'weapon' in the game needing to be used immediately in front of the enemy.

Other gameplay modes include "Tournament" (single-player, computer opponents), "Freestyle" (players make up own game rules), and "Challenge" (single-player, shot practice).

Tips:

9 Ball Championship Secret Warp
To skip the first four qualifying opponents in the 9-Ball Championship, go to challenge mode and select
Speed Pool. Get a score of 140 or lower and exit out to the tournament mode. After selecting 9-Ball and your break type you will be warped to the next level automatically skipping the first four opponents.

Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool was a 1992 video game that starred Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah and only released in North America. The instruction manual contains a popular Engrish that is recognized by many gamers, "As is Chester Cheetah way, is one-person play." The Engrish spawned due to bad translations and an intent to rhyme in a verse form similar to Dr. Seuss' anapestic tetrameter.

Rambo ain't got nothin' on you. You are an ace chopper pilot who must go behind enemy lines to rescue hostages. Your chopper is armed to the teeth and ready for action, so get out there and save those people. Who knows how much longer they can hold on, they're counting on you, man. I mean what kinda person are you to sit here and read a review when these people are being tortured? Get out there, man, NOW!!

Choplifter 3 is a great game with much better graphics than the first two: amazing detail on the tanks and the explosions. The music and sound in this game keep true to the military top secret mission kinda genre, I mean we're talking Rambo-worthy music here. This game is simple and fun, which goes to prove that the simple games are often the most fun.

Directions:

Choplifter 3 is a suicide mission made into a video game, although we all know that you're so good that you'll make it back. Take off from your base and fly around saving hostages. Destroy anything in your path that tries to stop you, such as tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and other choppers.

Fire your machine gun or use several new weapons, such as heat seeking missiles, napalm, and even nukes, all of which float down from the sky with parachutes.

Fly around four different levels (each with 4 sub-levels) such as the jungle, ocean, city, and the desert headquarters. At the end of each level is a boss, a huge tank (except for the ocean, where it's a battleship) which gets bigger with each level. This version, unlike the two prior Choplifter games, includes a repair station which will give you your full health back. You only get 4 lives, or 7 if you go into the Options menu and change it, so be careful saving those people. Good Luck, Pilot!!

THE WORLD OF CHRONO TRIGGER

Living in the seemingly peaceful kingdom of Guardia in 1000 A.D., the child CRONO was chosen by guardian spirits to save the world from ultimate devastation. Though Doomsday will not happen until the year 1999, the ancient seeds of destruction were planted long ago by the evil LAVOS. Your mission in the world of CHRONO TRIGGER is to travel back and forth through time to change the course of history, and stop Lavos from succeeding in his dark plan. On your journey, you will battle monsters and meet many helpful people in both the past and the future. Some will become your faithful and powerful companions, while others will give you clues by telling you stories. Pay attention to what they say, and good luck in your adventure.

FUTURE

In the future, 2300 A.D., the world has almost been destroyed by the evil Lavos. Those who survive are hungry, hurt, and hopeless. Find out how to help them, because the future of the world depends on you.

PRESENT

In 1000 A.D., beneath the surface of peaceful surroundings, monsters from the past are scheming to destroy the world while residents, unaware of the approaching peril, celebrate in the kingdom of Guardia.

PAST

Back in 600 A.D., humans are at war against monsters controlled by the evil Prince of Darkness. He has already defeated many Guardia knights, so in order to help them, you must travel even further back - to 65 Million B.C. - when Lavos first arrived on earth.

--From the SNES Chrono Trigger instruction manual.

Overview:

Chrono Trigger is one of the best early role playing games made. Thats why it shipped more than 2.36 million copies in Japan and 290,000 abroad. The graphics were very colorful and detailed. The controls were easy to use, and had a high functionality. The music in this game was also very successful. The are several songs from the game that are widely recognized by it's huge fanbase. The major stand out of this game from others was the storyline and how there were several different ones depending on what you decided to do in the game. This made the replayability factor very high. This is a must play for any classic gamer.

Directions:

Chrono Trigger features standard console role-playing game (RPG) gameplay with several innovations. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons

Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Trigger's gameplay deviates from that of traditional RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.

Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. Each character and enemy has a certain number of hit points, and successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, while hit points can be restored with potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose. Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles. Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in treasure chests. 

By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through Chrono Trigger's story.

Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed statistic counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called "Techs". Techs deplete a character's magic points (a numerical meter like hit points), and often have special areas of effect; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of Chrono Trigger's Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist. Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning Cyclone Tech can be combined with Lucca's Flame Toss to create Fire Whirl. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

Chrono Trigger features several other unique gameplay traits, including time travel. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called "time gates", as well as a time machine named Epoch. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how he or she reaches and completes the game's final battle. Chrono Trigger also introduces a New Game+ optionafter completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character levels, techniques, and equipment (but not money) that he or she ended the previous game with. Certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. 

Controls:

A Button - Talk, Accept, enter areas on the world map
B Button - Dash / Cancel
X Button - Open Menu
Y Button - Change Party Members, Time compass on Epoch
L+R Buttons - Run from battle
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - View World Map

Infinite Shelters
When you exit Guardia Forest in the beginning of the game there is a bush near the exit that will move, when
you try to communicate with it a strange creature should run out dropping a free shelter, after this leave the forest towards the castle but don't progress further, instead go back into the forest to where the bush was, you will be able to interact with it again thusly giving you another free shelter.

The perfect place to test your might, the Coliseum offers a new challenge to old veterans and breathes new life into the renowned battle system of Chrono Trigger. It is also arguably the most complicated event hack of the game to date, serving as indisputable proof that the Temporal Flux editor indeed has unlocked countless opportunities for reshaping the game. Three modes of difficulty are available for solo or party battles, and points can be accumulated to achieve rewards. Additionally, a cameo by a legendary swordsman appears for those who beat Hard mode on Solo.

Come on, who hasn't played Chrono Trigger? All of Square's biggest talents teamed with Dragon Quest producer Yuji Horii and character designer Akira Toriyama to make a truly classic RPG. It's amazing to think that from a company that puts all of its resources into the Final Fantasy franchise, most people instead consider Chrono Trigger to be the best RPG ever made. Yep, it's that good. All the loser Squaresoft fanboys you keep seeing and managing to talk to? Play Chrono Trigger and you'll understand.

You play as Crono, a mute (yet beloved.. why?) character whose friend Lucca accidentally creates a rift in the space-time continuum and sucks a girl back four hundred years in time. You go in to rescue her and set in motion a chain of events that will save the world from total destruction a thousand years from now by an evil otherworldly entity. It's a good game, seriously.

Translation Description:

So, you're probably wondering why a great game that already had a decent translation and a recently released retranslation from fans would need another fan translation. Normally, I'd be wondering the same thing. However, here we are.

Late in January of 2008, I had a desire to play Chrono Trigger again after having not played for at least 7 years. When I discovered that KWhazit, ZeaLitY, and company had finished a new English retranslation, I immediately applied it to the game and started playing.

No, discredit to them, but I felt much of the text was incoherent and/or awkward. I soon discovered I was not the only one who felt this way. Therefore, instead of complaining, I decided to take action. I acquired all the necessary tools to begin doing my re-retranslation. For the next 3 months, I went to work.

I want to make it clear that, despite not enjoying their version, I would not have been able to do this without Chrono Compendium's retranslation forerunners like ZeaLitY and KWhazit. The resources they provided pointed me in the right direction to complete this.

In the end, here are the fruits of my labor. I aimed not so much for a literal translation, but localization, clear and easily understood text, and the inclusion of any missing elements left out from the US version due to Nintendo's censorship policy from back in the day.

Hopefully, you'll find it to be an enjoyable experience.

*NOTES* I will not provide you or tell you where to get an illegal ROM image of Chrono Trigger. Don't ask. You are expected to provide your own legit copy.

Regarding the change of the element icon 'Lightning' to 'Sky' and then to 'Heaven' in my version: I have strong reasoning for doing this. I will explain. The Japanese character used for Crono's element can be rendered as Sky or Heaven in English. ZeaLitY decided on Sky. However, here are my reasons for choosing Heaven:

1. Crono's final tech's, Shining (Luminaire in original English version), description reads literally from Japanese, "Ultimate holy magic on all enemies." Any version of heaven across all cultures in a spiritual, metaphysical, or magical sense is associated with being holy.

2. If the element truly was supposed to be Sky, why would the localization team change it to Lightning? Such changes were generally only done for three reasons: The original meaning held religious context (as heaven does), cultural difference no one here would readily understand, or was of an adult nature.

I based my ROM edit off of a copy of Chrono Trigger patched with Chrono Compendium's retranslation patch. So, their CronoNick fix and the ending artwork are both still in-tact. I take no credit for these whatsoever and you have them to thank.

Hacked By: Chrono Compendium
_________________________

Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes was a fan project modification of the Chrono Trigger ROM begun in late 2004. Development continued thanks to a dedicated group of fans through 2009. By May 2009, the game featured ~35 hours of game play, 10 multiple endings, and 23 chapters, much like the original Chrono Trigger; it was around 98% complete. The plot featured the original cast as they struggled against a new villain risen from the legacy of Zeal.

The team planned to release Crimson Echoes on May 31, 2009 as the first feature-length fan Chrono series game, and an unprecedentedly exhaustive work in the ROM modification community. On May 8, 2009, Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes received a cease & desist letter, along with all other game modification activity (even research) at the Chrono Compendium. In compliance with the letter, the development team ceased development on the game, and existing modifications (including Prophet's Guile) were taken down.

We thank those fans who followed the game's development, and also those who poured countless hours into the vision of a fun, new Chrono game, made by fans for fans without copyright claim or intent to make profit.

We understand the frustration. I sincerely hope this action is a sign that Square Enix cares about the franchise and intends to produce future titles, and not merely a shortsighted legal exercise that will further alienate a tired, neglected fan-base.

In Chrono Trigger, and many other games for that matter, there's often a fine line, in terms of levels, between certain scenarios being really easy or rather hard.  Level Zero, formerly Frozen in Time, began as a modification geared towards smoothing some of these rough edges in Chrono Trigger's mechanics.  Frozen in Time aimed to "correct" these problems by removing the level-up, and then changing character and enemy stats to balance the final result.  Store and weapon tweaks were made as well.

While these changes more or less got the job done, it made other gameplay problems more glaring, and it added a few of its own.  Massive item tweaks (weapons, armor, helmets, accessories, consumables) were made.  A few story-based stat changes have been added or changed.  I disabled tabs (or more accurately, replaced them with "gems" that can only be sold, but for more money).  Technique power and costs are changed.  The mod as a whole is far more balanced now.  While PrismSpecs are still the best accessory, there are many others that can now hold their own or even come out ahead in the right situation.

This is not a hardtype hack, but the difficulty is a bit on the high side.  Even though you can't level up, you should still be able to win from any save on the overworld map (with the possible exception of pre-Blackbird), even if you have sold or missed many major items.  If you think you need a certain rare item to complete the game, that item may in fact no longer be rare, or there may be other items that you can use instead.

Easy Intro:

You don't level-up anymore, so your stats don't increase.  Various things have been tweaked to make it playable: Characters, enemies, weapons, armors, helmet, accessory, items, techniques, and a few events.  The game difficulty will tend to be a little harder, but results will vary depending on your playing style.

WARNING: Right now, PG freezes SNES9x during a certain part, making the game impossible to finish. The latest version of ZSNES works.

Chrono Trigger: Prophet's Guile is a fan game following the story of Magus's rise to power in the Kingdom of Zeal after arriving in 12000 B.C. thanks to the distortion at his lair. In his bid to stop Lavos at the Ocean Palace, Magus must gain the trust of Queen Zeal and abolish all opposition. It's about two regular Chrono Trigger chapters long, and full of surprises.

Work on Chrono Trigger: Prophet's Guile began in January 2007. ZeaLitY suggested that the Crimson Echoes team, sidelined for the moment, develop a short ROM hack to be released in a couple months. Unfortunately, other matters came into play and after the backbone of the game was coded, work halted and shifted back to Crimson Echoes. In December 2007, Chrono'99 revived the project and thanks to a collaborative effort with his leadership, Prophet's Guile now stands complete. The only casualty of the development process was a plan to resprite Magus as the Prophet, which would have involved exhaustive work.

Chuck's Gonna Get You, Gary Gritter!

Back when men were cavemen and women had names like Ophelia, Chuck Rock was one and his wife--well, her name was Ophelia.

And their matrimonial bliss was complete. Strong of jaw and big of belly--just a little weak in the frontal lobe department--Chuck was nevertheless a prosperous, upwardly mobile hunter-gatherer. And the fair Ophelia was a swell little cavemaker.

But, as is often the case--for envy skulks and skulks on the outskirts of lives so blessed--the connubial rapture of Chuck and Ophelia was not to continue unabated. One dark day, Chuck returned from flinging gravel at migrating pterodactyls to find Ophelia--or rather not to find her--vanished! Worse--she'd been kidnapped! And by none other than Chuck's former rival for Ophelia's affections, the nefarious Gary Gritter, tough as stones and a whole lot heavier.

Now, needless to say, Chuck's got a bone to pick with Gary--a bone about the size of a brontosaurus' thigh. That is, if and when Chuck can find that pebble-chewing wife-snatcher.

But in seeking his revenge (not to mention his wife), Chuck will have to kick and belly-butt his way through five challenging stages of play, with big bad bosses at the end of the lines. He'll encounter tough terrain and savage creatures... brave another Ice Age... bob and body-surf through a dangerous water world... face the terrors of a dinosaur boneyard... and--well, chuck some rocks, what else?

Hold on, Ophelia! And watch out, Gary! Here comes the dauntless Chuck Rock!

But the point is, this was and still is a brilliant concept for a game, and it's extremely fun to play no matter how many times you've played before. There are so many different ways to play, strategies to explore, different computer opponents who actually behave and interact differently. It really is a different game every time you play. Also it's fortunately one of the few games you can learn by playing, so just give it a try, sit down and have some fun for a while. Settle new cities, improve them with various structures including Wonders of the World, build armies, research new technologies, decide which form of government works best for your civilization. 

You can make war or peace with your neighbors, establish trade routes, develop a spy network to steal technology or subvert your enemies' cities, or buy his armies right out from under him! Or go for the Space Race, be the first civilization to send a colony ship to Alpha Centauri and be declared the Leader of Earth!

Hints:

Settlers
The most powerful unit in the game is not the Armor, or the Artillery, or the mighty Bomber, or even the Nuke. That's right, it's the humble Settler. The most important thing you can do early in the game is make several cities as quickly as possible, and conquest often is not your best option here. A little later, through mid- and end-game, you'll need extra settlers improving the landscape around your existing cities. Roads increase Trade, which dictates both money and science for your civilization, and of course Irrigation increases your food which helps your cities grow and use all the available resources.

Clay Fighter came out when fighters were at their peak, using cool 3D graphics in a fighting game. The result was a weird looking fighter that's lacking in game-play but overflowing with novelty. I will give Clay Fighter credit for coming up with something that is imaginative.

The well-rendered but undesirable clay characters are: an Elvis impersonator, a scarecrow, a blob, a fat opera woman, and an evil snowman. Definitely unusual characters. There are some humorous animations and sounds, such as the Elvis saying, "Thank you very much" after defeating someone.

The fighters perform very strange attacks, using their clay form to change shape. While pretty funny and entertaining at first, ultimately it means more sucker punches and less skill shots. And though the clay fighters are rendered pretty well, they aren't animated very smoothly, making it hard to make out what's going on in close combat.

Directions:

It's a one or two player fighter: Kill each other! Pick your fighter and try to beat every other fighter, thus beating the game. Or in two player mode, you can try to beat your friends. The eight different characters are, Bad Mr. Frosty, Blob, Blue Suede Goo, Bonker, Helga, Ichabod Clay, Taffy, and Tiny. Each one has four different special moves to learn. Special moves can be performed by pressing a combination of the attack buttons and the directional pad. For instance, the Blob can perform a ranged attack called clay spit by pressing quarter circle Forward and Punch. Ickabod Clay can perform a teleport move by pressing Down and Y plus B. Bad Mr. Frosty can do a shoulder charge if you press Back, Forward, then Punch. Experiment to find more moves, and use them to your best advantage!

Controls:

A Button - Med. Kick
B Button - Quick Kick
X Button - Med. Punch
Y Button - Quick Punch
L Button - Brutal Punch
R Button - Brutal Kick
Start Button - Pause/Start
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Blob's Buzz Saw
When using Blob's Buzz Saw attack, keep pressing toward your opponent even if he blocks it. This move will keep hitting him several times. 

Tips:

Unlock N Boss
Play a one player game all the way through to the N Boss. Lose both rounds intentionally. After the game
ends, wait for the option screen to appear, select the Vs. Battle option. Player 2 will be controlling N Boss.

Clayfighter: Tournament Edition was a Super Nintendo exclusive fix of the original with many things changed, such as:

 - Most stages from the original were modified. Bad Mr. Frosty & Blob's stages had no changes, however (as well as N. Boss's stage, since his was just a recolor of Blob's stage), while the other six fighters had edited stages. The edits were either slightly edited, some redone from scratch.

 - Many glitches from the original were fixed. Notably, the glitch to play as N. Boss was removed.

 - Many new modes were added, more versus modes were added, since it is a 'tournament' edition.

 - The intro and title screen were edited.

Mudville USA, home to Professor Putty and his son Clayton, was for the most part a peaceful place. This afternoon however, it was all about to change. It started out like any other day, Clayton going off to school, leaving his father at home with his experiments. Today, however, his father was on the verge of a fantastic breakthrough, and Clayton could barely keep his mind on his lessons. As soon as the last bell rang, Clayton raced home, hoping to get there in time to help his father with his work.

Half a world away another person eagerly awaited Professor Putty's breakthrough. Through the smoke of his magic cauldron, the eyes of the wicked witch doctor, Jobo, looked down upon Mudville. Would this upstart professor be able to do what only he, the great Jobo, was able to do? To turn living creatures into clay! There was only one way to know for sure, to go there in person. With some incantations and a puff of brimstone he was on his way.

Clayton ran up the porch and into the house only to be knocked to the floor by an explosion coming from the basement. Startled and a little bit scared, Clayton looked up to see his father smiling with success. It had worked! The claymorph serum worked! Suddenly there was a second explosion and in a cloud of smoke the witch doctor Jobo appeared. Claiming the powers over clay were his alone, Jobo demanded the serum and its formula.

Professor Putty was not going to let his breakthrough go without a fight, but he was powerless to stop the wicked Jobo. Seeing that he was not going to get his way, Jobo seized the professor and turned the protesting Clayton into a ball of clay, escaping in another puff.

Now it's up Clayton to rescue his father, and the serum, which will turn him back into a little boy. He will face many dangers as he travels to the ends of the earth, and possibly beyond, if he is to finish his quest. To aid him in his quest, Clayton had the ability to transform into five different animals with the help of different pieces of clay he may find along the way. Each of the five animals has its own abilities and skills, and he will need them all as he runs, jumps, flies, swims, and climbs past anything in his way.

--From the SNES Claymates instruction manual.

Overview:

A scientist that Clayton knows has developed a formula to manipulate clay into animals. Some kind of weird witch doctor wants the formula and after the scientist refuses he changes Clayton into a ball of clay and steals the formula with the professor. Somehow Clayton's Backyard and various other levels have been turned into mazes and filled with hostile creatures. Using bits of formula lying around in these levels you can transform into animals to best fit with the environment and make it to the end of the level. This game is very child-like and out of the 8 button controller only 3 are used.

Directions:

Use special abilities that are in a clay ball to transform you into helpful animals as you race the clock to collect as much as possible and still make it to the end. Jump over obstacles and attack with the animal in use. Be careful not to be hit while a blob or you'll die.

Controls:

A Button - N/A
B Button - Jump
X Button - N/A

Clock Tower: The First Fear
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Adventure
Release Year: 2001
Original Title: Clock Tower: The First Fear
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.01
_________________________
*
I played maybe five minutes into Clock Tower when the translation first came out, and I really didn't get it. As such, I wrote a horrible review here. But now that I've played it again, I realize I really didn't give it a fair shake the first time around. So let me try again.

It all starts off when Jennifer Simpson is taken from her orphanage along with some other girls to live in this huge, spooky mansion. All the other girls suddenly disappear, and you're left there alone. And, now you have to go through the mansion and find out what's going on. I should note that Clock Tower is scary. Anyone who thinks that the Super NES is not able to produce a truly frightening atmosphere should check this out and be proven wrong. Saying any more about it would probably ruin things a bit.

Clock Tower is an adventure game, like, uhh, Maniac Mansion or such. You move a pointer around and tell Jennifer where to walk to, and you can click on things and she'll look at them or pick them up or whatever. One thing I don't like about the game is the fact that Jennifer walks so sloooowly. Maybe it's to heighten the effect or whatever, but I keep wanting to reach over for my Speedup key. You can make her run, but running depletes her health by quite a bit. Not like it matters for most of the game, but you will want that health when it counts. SLOW! You shouldn't be penalized for running. Anyways.

Oh! I almost forgot? Multiple endings! I love multiple endings, and not that Star Ocean 2 "eighty slightly different variations on one ending" crap, we're talking nine separate endings, depending on how you do things, where you go, who you talk to, and stuff. A super nice touch, that really ups the replay value here.

Everything is translated. La!

Mr. Body is found dead and someone in the house killed him. I say it was Ms. Scarlett in the Study with the Revolver, but that may not be the case (I mean she says she's innocent, but there seems to be nothing innocent about her). It's up to you to find out who really did it (I'm telling you, Ms. Scarlett). Go through the house picking up clues to find out the real Killer. Good luck, Detective.

The classic game of "Who done it" is now a video game. The graphics are good, right down to a realistic hand that rolls the dice. The music is good when it plays, but otherwise it's practically non-existent. This game, like Monopoly, views the game board from above as if you are really playing the board game on your console. So good luck figuring out the murder.

Directions:

This is the classic mystery board game, turned into digits and put on your computer. Run around the mansion and explore the rooms, making suggestions as to who you think did it. The suggestions will reveal clues about rooms, where the weapons were, who had them, and who was where.

You also get two interrogations that will let you do the same thing no matter where in the house you are. After putting all the clues together, make your Play.

By yourself against the computer, or play with a friend, choose from your favorite classic characters: Ms. Scarlett, Col. Mustard, Mrs. White, Mr. Greene, Mrs. Peacock, and Prof. Plum. Oh, and one more thing: if you can play the board game, you can play this. Good Luck, Gumshoe!

"And the pass is caught for a TOUCHDOWN!"

Remember when sports games weren't updated every year? There was never an update to this game (at least from my knowledge), and I am glad of this. After all, after playing a game like this, who needs a College Football USA 98? Not me, and I probably would not have purchased it, anyways, had they come out with one. I mean, this game was near perfection already, and I enjoy playing it a lot, so why would I need an updated version that featured just updated teams and players? It doesn't really sound that improved to me.

College Football USA '97 is definitely one of my favorite Super Nintendo games of all time, and I enjoy playing it, even to this day. The game is just so much fun to play, as it features every college football team that was around in late-1996. Well, at least all the division 1-A teams, but I can live without playing as Cal State Ruthridge, and I am sure you can too, right? The game is just so much fun to play, and I would reccomend that any person who likes college football should buy this game.

There is not really much of a storyline to this game, but what should you expect? I mean, this is a college football game. Therefore, as in mostly any other sports game, there really is no storyline to it. All you really have to remember is that you are trying to lead a team to the national championship. That's about the whole basis of any storyline the game would provide.

College Football USA 97 definitely features excellent graphics. The backgrounds looked pretty cool, and the player designs were great as well. The stadiums were recreated wondefully, and overall it looks like you're watching a real college football game (only without any commentary). I really liked the graphics in the game, as there was barely any breakup in them, especially during the long throws. And I remember some games in which there was actually graphical breakup in the field when you tried to throw a long pass, so I am glad none of that is featured in this game.

Another thing I liked about the graphics in this game is the fact that the team logos and overall presentation of the game is top notch. I have always been a relatively big fan of graphical presentation in sports games, so I was definitely pleased by the graphical presentation of this game. The team logos and players are all featured here, and the game looks so nice, whether you are talking about the actual game itself, or the design of the various menus. And I am definitely a huge fan of that, without a shadow of a doubt.

The music in this game is pretty impressive, although there is not that much music featured in the game. The music that is in the game is pretty darn good, however. First off, I really liked the music featured in the various menus and title screens, it was very well done. It had this nice beat to it that I really happened to enjoy, and it surprised me too. The music featured during the actual game is good too, because you can actually hear some of the schoool band's music, like Notre Dame's fight song. It is definitely an awesome idea that was executed very well.

The sound effects in the game are pretty good, as well, as long as you can live without commentary. Yes, there is no commentary featured in this game, but you can pretty much figure out why that is the case. The reason is, if you have not figured it out yet, is the simple fact that the Super Nintendo could not handle commentary, because of the limited capabilities of its sound proccessors. So, the game does not feature commentary. it does feature some awfully good sound effects though, especially things like bone crushing hits, and players screaming. It is sort of like the Madden series when it comes to sound effects, if that helps you to imagine what the sound effects sound like.

It is so easy to control everyone in this game. There is no passer windows, which I am a huge fan of because the passer windows got in your way too much. It is so much better to play the game without passer windows and will delight those gamers who hated passer windows in the old Madden games. The passer windows got annoying because you would want to throw the ball down the field and suddenly the windows would pop up on the top of the screen. In this game, you can see the whole field then target the passer. It definitely makes passing a whole lot easier.

Yeah, it is a college football game. It's pretty good, as well. It has the College Football license, which mean you get all the team names, ranging from sorry Nebraska and Florida State to thr best college football teams in America (Notre Dame, Penn State) (and who said I was biased :) Anyways, you don't get the players names, just their numbers, because of NCAA regualtions. This is no biggie, though, because the game still rules.

There are a lot of game modes featured in this game. All of the expected modes are here, like preseason, exhibition, etc. I really liked the season mode in this game, because you get to experience the feeling of the poll system. The object of the game is to get to #1 on the polls as quickly as possible, which is hard to do if you are a team like Tulane. However, it is not impossible to get there, as I have taken teams like Oregon State and led them to the national championship. The bowl system in this game is well done, as well, as all of the major bowls are represented, and even some of the smaller ones, as well. And you do not have to worry about college politics like the real college football schools do, which is always an advantage.

The other modes are pretty fun, too. Arguing with a friend over which college football team is better? Battle it out on the gridiron with this game! This is one of my favorite multiplayer games on the Super Nintendo, because the two player mode is so much fun. You can even take advantage of the multitap's capabilities and have four-player wars, as well. Cool, huh? The exhibition mode is fun for those that want to test out your skills with a certain team but don't feel like going through an entire season to do it. And there is also the game training mode, which has your players run drills. It is definitely a fun aspect of the game, without a doubt.

The replay value in this game is impressive, although it does not have nearly the same amount of replay value as some of the other sports games featured on Super Nintendo. Regardless, the replay value is pretty high based on three reasons. The first reason is the season mode. The season mode is addictive and it is fun to watch how the polls shape up each and every week. The second reason is the multiplayer aspect. This is addictive and it is also one of the better party games on the Super Nintendo. The thrid and final reason is the simple fact that this game is so much fun to play.

The only flaw I can really mention about this incredible game is the fact that it is not that challenging. Sadly enough, this is definitely the case, because I barely had any problems going through the season mode on the default challenge level. When I switched the challenge level up higher, I expected it to get much tougher, but sadly that did not turn out to be the case. Regardless, the game is stil kind of challenging, it is just not as challenging as I expected, that's all.

Hey college football fans who don't have a Playstation, this is your only choice. Maybe even if you have a Playstation. Seriously, this is one of, if not the best, college football games out there. Get it today!! I really did enjoy playing this game, and I do feel that it is one of the best college football games featured on any system. It is a lot of fun to play, and has high replay value. The graphics in the game are impressive, and the music is great. The control is better because of the lack of passer windows, and overall the game is just plain fun!

Good Points
-The lack of passer windows makes the game a lot more fun to play.
-The season mode is very addictive because of the polls element.
-The graphics are simply awesome, and there is little graphical breakup present.
-It is one of the best sports games on the Super Nintendo, no questions asked.

Not So Good Points
-The game could have been a lot more challenging, as I was disappointed by how easy the season mode was.
-There could have been more teams featured, like Division-1AA schools.
-Notre Dame and Penn State always get killed by Nebraska in the season mode when you don't control them.
-There still is signs of graphical breakup.

I Run Down the Ratings.. DaLadiesMan style!
Storyline - Not Available
Graphics - 9.3/10
Music - 9.2/10
Sound Effects - 9.2/10
Control - 9.8/10
Gameplay - 9.6/10
Replay Value - Way Above Average
Challenge - Sadly, Below Average
Worth a Purchase? - Definitely.
Overall - 9.2/10

The Last Line: This is one of the best games featured on the Super Nintendo, at least in my mind, and it is well worth a purchase, if you can find it at a good enough price.

Congo the Movie: The Secret of Zinj
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (USA)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Light Gun , Shooter
Developer: Viacom
_________________________
*
Congo was being developed by Viacom, and it was based on the movie of the same name. It is unrelated to the Sega Saturn game of the same name. Here are some comments that I have dug up.

On the digitpress forum, a poster named furor had the following information:

"That list brought back some horrible memories. I almost forgot that a snes version of congo even existed. I worked over at Viacom and actually got to play it some. The game sucked so bad that we cancelled it. So, I know for a fact that it was never released."

"No protos, screen shots, or info on the game that I know of. All I can tell you about the game is that is was a pretty bad rip off of Donkey Kong Country. It was a side scroller where you controlled a poorly animated gorilla picking up diamonds instead of banana's."

If you want to read the thread, this is the link:

http://www.digitpress.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6765&highlight=congo

I went and did some digging on usenet, and I found this, dated 1995/12/05:

"I was just curious because Visual Concepts was programming SNES and Genesis Congo for us at Viacom, and it sucked hard. Worst game I have ever played. The whole testing department complained so much that the big guys finally listened and cancelled it."

Martin of Nesworld went one step further, and managed to contact the developer of the game. It is a pretty sad story of tight schedules and overworked employees. His story is documented here (along with pics from the prototype cart):

NESworld Archives - Congo

Now that the game is available, it is quite impressive for a game made in 5 months. The control is quite dicey, though, and the one hit deaths on the non-shooting levels make it very frustrating. The graphics are in the upper tier as far as snes games go. It is a shame that there wasn't more time to polish this, as it is very promising. It is certainly better than a lot of crappy lisenced games, like Last Action Hero or Cliffhanger.

It's an Evolution Revolution!

If you were a monkey, just hangin' out in the jungle with your chimp-chick, and a magic ruby fell out of the sky and zapped you both, turning you into half-humans, and a demon-kid swooped down and made off with your girl - what would you do? You'd high-tail it after them and stop at nothing to save her, that's what - 'cause you're Congo, the monkey-turned-superkid, and only you can uphold the Law of the Jungle! But it's more than a jungle out there - your search for little Congette will take you from ghost towns to pirate ships to ninja castles to the belly of a Tyrannosaurus. This is no time for a banana-break - you'd better get down to monkey business!

--From the SNES Congo's Caper instruction manual.

Overview:

Congo the Monkey's girlfriend has been stolen by the Demon-king (there's a story-line that's been done to death) and it's up to you to get her back. If that wasn't enough, a magic crystal fell from the sky and turned you and your girlfriend into half-human monkey creatures. Fight through several different worlds and defeat the Demon-king's minions to get your girlfriend back and live happily ever after.

Congo's Caper is a very fun game that is very much like Joe and Mac in the way that it plays, although there are differences that make the game unique, such as high jump and the way life works. The graphics in this game are excellent all around and the music is captivating. I highly recommend this game for a fun way to past the time.

Directions:

Congo's Caper is fun platform game that you can play alone, or you take turns with a friend beating the game in the 2 player mode. Fight through five stages such as Epilogue stage, Modern stage, Viking stage, Halloween stage, and T-rex.

At the end of each stage, you will be faced off with a boss that varies in size from large to huge, and that takes a strategy to beat. Learn the strategy and beat the boss. The bosses include the Ninja Master, the Spaceship, the Viking captain, the Vampire, and finally the Demon-king who stole your girlfriend.

Collect yellow crystals along your way to get extra lives and red crystals to restore your health. When you get down to where you have no health left, you will change back into a monkey, and if you get hit after that, you die and lose a life. Lose all your lives and it's Game Over. Collect a blue crystal to get a spin on the slots, get three in a row and get an extra life. All in all this a fun ad entertaining game. So sit down, log in, and have fun! 

Controls:

A Button - JUMP
B Button - JUMP
X Button - ATTACK
Y Button - ATTACK
Start Button - PAUSE
Select Button - NOTHING

Level Passwords:

Contra III: The Alien Wars
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1992
Developer: Konami
Publisher: Konami
_________________________
*
The game takes place in a dismal 2636, two years after the events of Super Contra. The protagonists Bill Rizer and Lance Bean are deployed once again to counter an alien invasion. In the original North American localization of Contra III, Bill and Lance were renamed "Jimbo" and "Sully" respectively. Since the North American localization of Contra and Super C on the NES changed the setting to present time, while Contra III took place in the 27th century, an explanation was given in the manual that Jimbo and Sully were actually the descendants of Bill and Lance from the previous games. In the PAL version, Bill and Lance are replaced once again by cyborg units RD008 and RC011. The original names of the character would be restored in the English localization of Contra: Shattered Soldier, which followed the Japanese continuity.

Gameplay:

Taking advantage of the then new technology provided by the Super NES, The Alien Wars graphics improved upon those of earlier games. The level design is more complex, and provides more opportunity for interaction than was possible in previous Contra installments. For instance, players can grab on to poles and navigate them in a monkey bar fashion, climb walls and ladders, destroy buildings and scenery, and commandeer tanks.

New styles of levels in The Alien Wars involve motorcycle chases, riding on missiles, and two Mode 7 enabled overhead levels similar to those in Super Contra. The weapons system is revamped, and players can carry two weapons instead of one, only losing the one they are currently using if they die. They can also fire these two weapons simultaneously in a spin-jump circular fire pattern that hit enemies on all sides: however, being hit while doing so results in the player losing both of their weapons. Finally, the player now starts off with the assault rifles instead of the semi-automatic rifle, much like Operation C, eliminating the need to tap the fire button rapidly.

Top View Stages:

There are two top-view stages in the game: Stage 2 (the Collapsed Highway) and Stage 5 (the Steep Cliffs). The controls in the top-view stages differs from those in Super Contra and Operation C. The player's character always faces the same direction when moved with the control pad and must be rotated with the shoulder buttons L or R. The perspective differs depending on which game mode is played. When these stages are played in 1-Player Mode, the character always faces up and the area rotates around him instead. In 2 Players A Mode, these stages uses a horizontal split-screen format, with the first player's half of the screen on the top and second player's half on the bottom. Both characters face right in this mode. In 2-Players B Mode, both players share the same screen and their characters rotate while the perspective remains fixed for both players.

The objective in these stages are also different from the standard side-scrolling ones. Rather than moving into a linear path towards the end of the stage to face a stage boss, the player must first destroy a series of targets situated at fixed locations. The player may select their landing point at the start of the stage, while on-screen arrows helps the player lead their character to the nearest target. After all targets are destroyed, the player is transported to a new area to face the boss.

Difficulty:

Since the North American localization has no cheat code to extend the player's amount of lives, the game is noteworthy for its high level of difficulty. There are three levels of difficulty in the game - easy, normal, and hard. Each increase in difficulty setting also alters several parts of the gameplay. For example, enemy bosses, when fought on the hard difficulty, will have new attacks or modifications to their already-existing attacks and patterns. Also, some situations in the game, such as flying in the air on missiles, become more difficult, as the missiles will travel much faster on higher difficulties. In addition, some objects and boss weak points that were destructible on easier difficulty levels will become indestructible on normal and hard mode, making the game a challenge to many experienced game players familiar with shooters.

Endings:

If the game is finished in easy or normal mode, instead of a standard ending followed by a staff roll, the player sees a message requesting the player try the next difficulty level. On hard mode, the last boss has a final form not present in the other modes. After defeating this form, which the player must do while escaping the collapsing alien base, the true ending is finally revealed.

Controls:

A Button - Bomb
B Button - Jump (Platformer) / Crouch (Top-down)
X Button - Change Weapon
Y Button - Fire
L Button - Turn Left (Top-down)
R Button - Turn Right (Top-down)
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Show Map (Top-down)

Hints:

Dual Simultaneous Fire
You can shoot both weapons at the same time. Although this does for clearing out the area, it's very risky because you could lose BOTH your weapons. In order to do this, you hold L and R and press the fire button. In platformer mode, you jump and spin. In top-down mode, you just spin.

Tips:

Infinite lives
Note: It will speed up the process if you use a turbo controller. When you get to level 3, fight your way through the
stage until you get to the mini boss 'The Flying Squito Nest' (the mini boss after you climb the building). Make sure you have the machine gun as your weapon or this won't work. Position your character as far to the left of the screen as you can and have him facing the right. Tape down the Y button and turn on your turbo mode. Set your controller down and come back in a few minutes to get a lot of lives (your lives max out when they get to 29).

Secret Ending
Beat the Game on the Hard Difficulty Setting to view a special ending not seen after beating the other two difficulties.

Cool World

It's an imaginary world that's real. It exists in another dimension, where cartoon characters, called Doodles, are alive. It's Cool World.

For cartoonist Jack Deebs, who's been carried across the boundary, it's a wild and amazing place; and he's discovered that only some of the Doodles are friendly. Take Holli Would. She's a knockout Doodle who's really interested in Jack. She's interested in using him to get herself a real body and transfer into this world. She just needs to get her hands on one special piece of magic.

The Golden Spike of power, hidden atop the Ocean Hotel in Las Vegas, is the powerful wedge between Cool World and this world. And Holli's trying to steal it. If she uses it, she may destroy both her world and Jack's.

As Jack, you have to stop her from doing it - because you know she will if she can!

Corn Buster is an unreleased Super Nintendo game developed by Engine Software. The game is the story of a dragon named Globey, who sets out to defeat the person who's stolen all the cornflakes in the world. The gameplay is an interesting mix of an Arkanoid-Style ball-and-paddle game and a vertical scrolling shooter. The game quietly began development around 1994, and was canceled soon after interest in the Super Nintendo waned in light of the release of Sony's Playstation. Some time ago, Engine Software released a ROM of the game for free download on their website. The download page has since been removed, but the ROM is still easily obtainable. The game was 70-80% completed before it was canceled.

Directions:
You have two characters to choose from. Once you pick one, you will have to fight your way out of town. There are several weapons you can find including pistols, and different swords. It is a pretty open ended game. There are a lot of different ways to go. There are also a good many moves to learn. If you tap the attack button fast enough, you will perform combos. If you press down and attack, you will perform a sliding attack. Cutthroat Island is a lot of fun, so check it out.

Double Teaming
If you start to get double teamed, turn around and quickly hit Y. Your offhand attack will knock the enemy back, giving you a chance to finish off your primary target. 

Tips:

Skip to Level 4
Begin playing in two player mode. Once you reach level 2 have player one stand in front of the first wooden

Original Title: Cyber Knight I
Translated By: Aeon Genesis

Cyber Knight is a really interesting game. It kinda fools you into thinking it's a sci-fi/mecha RPG with the traditional 8/16-bit RPG engine. Hell, looking at the screenshots of the overworld, you might be inclined to think it uses a similar engine to Phantasy Star 2. But that's just the overworld. Once you get into a battle, it's definitely a strategic game. The battles are waged on a 6-6 grid. Your fighters have missile and melee attacks, and essentially you move your men about and attack in a manner that doesn't wind up with your mechas getting obliterated. The battles are more involved than your standard RPG fare, and resultedly are a little slow-paced. So those of you who like Final Fantasy and Dragon Warriorwhere you can fly through a battle by hitting the accept button repeatedlymight not like this. The graphics are a bit dated, even for 1993. The sound is rather nice, however. And the game play is decent. So, if you have a grain or two of patience, this game will make for an enjoyable experience.

Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game , Turnbased , Fantasy
Release Year: 2005
Players: 1
Original Title: Cyber Knight II: Chikyuu Teikoku no Yabou
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.00
_________________________

Cyber Knight 2 is a direct story-sequel to Cyber Knight 1. The crew of the Spaceship Swordfish finally arrives back on Earth after they were lost in space. Things are not as great as they should be though, the crew is immediately imprisoned and the Swordfish, along with advanced technology from the middle of the universe, is being taken away. The Earth government tries to use the technology to conquer the surrounding galaxies.

While the story seems pretty simple and straight-forward at the beginning of the game, there are some really nice twists toward the end.

Game-Mechanics:

CK2 is a RPG with a very strategic battle system. Your party fights inside modules which are comparable to mechas that we all know from Anime series such as Mobile Suit Gundam. The battle takes place on a 6-5 square grid. Before each round you equip your modules with appropriate weapons and issue orders. The round is then fought automatically. There are several types of weapons like plasma, laser, shot, or heat weapons but there is also close combat. The strategic elements are knowing enemies weaknesses so you use the right weapon-types and the correct movement to stay out of close combat range, or intercept enemies in it. When an enemy is only 1 space beneath one of your modules, it can no longer attack in ranged combat, and vice versa. When you order one of your modules to attack an enemy in close combat and he moves away, your character will do nothing. You need to be able to estimate your enemies movement because of that.

Although this seems rather complicated, the battles play very swift, but if you don't want to fight every battle by yourself there is also an auto-battle option.

There are no items to find in the game the usual way, instead after battles you obtain parts from your enemy's remains. In the lab on your ship, they are then researched and unlock new weapon types to chose from, or upgrade the damage of your existing ones. While this is a interesting way to upgrade your modules, it makes the dungeons kind of boring. As there are no items to find outside battles there is no use in searching the areas for secrets, instead you only head straight for the dungeon's boss.

Graphics and Sound:

The graphics of the game range from bad to mediocre. The maps often look like they where done with only 3 different tiles, while some look ok. In some places you could even think you had a NES game and not a SNES one. The battles however actually look very good using big and very detailed sprites for your modules and the enemies.

The music is nothing special, but is not getting on your nerves either.

Conclusion:

Because of the very fun and unusual battle-system I recommend this game to all RPG-lovers who have enough of the standard RPG formula.

Translation Description:

Gideon Zhi did a marvelous job with this game. Along with Deuce, who translated the game, as well as z80gaiden and his mysterious friend who supplied compression tools for it, he finished this whole project in under two months! The patch is absolutely on par with any commercially released translation as it features a good looking VWF, multi-line item names and the complete script is even fully recompressed. Moreover the translation is great and very polished. I did not encounter a single piece of Japanese text in the entire game.

Applause to Gideon Zhi and his team for making this game available to the English speaking public!

Cyber Spin uses a top-down perspective and was designed in the same technique as classic arcade racing games. There are ten different tracks in the United States, Peru, Spain, Kenya, and England.[5] Players of the game become a part of a science-fiction version of the 2016 Formula One season. The goal is to win every race and to eventually win the championship. All of the automobiles are turbocharged with advanced futuristic technology. The player must qualify to make it into the main event. Unlike Circuit USA, the player does not automatically qualify for a race and must beat a certain time limit to advance the story line. There is a free mode, password mode and scenario mode which plays like a Japanese anime movie. In the scenario mode, the object is to guide an up and coming driver to the ultimate victory. Quitting once means game over.

Becoming an elite Cybernator warrior requires 1,000 hours of training in mock Cybernator combat. Ninety percent of all marines who attempt to take their seat in the Cybernator cockpit either drop out because of mental and physical fatigue, or are accidentally destroyed by their own incompetence.

Cyborg 009 is some kind of anime, I guess. There's these, uhh, nine, uh, cyborgs. Yeah, and they all have special abilities, and they fight crime? and I guess there's some kind of big bad guy that they fight, or something. So to recap, yeah, I've never heard of it.

This game, though, is an amazingly standard run-and-shoot-things action game. Think Megaman, I guess, except you can jump thirty feet into the air, but only for a distance of five or six feet. So yeah, platforming aspects really suck. It's also unlike Megaman in that you don't fight giant robots created by the nefarious Dr. Wily, and you don't get to absorb their attacks and use them on others. Also, your weapon has a very short range, unlike Megaman's famous Mega Buster. Okay, so I just meant "think Megaman" in the sense that you're running around and shooting things. I couldn't think of another example.

Of course, all run-and-shoot-things action games require some gimmick to distinguish it, and in this one you can choose a party of three to fight with, and you can select them with the L button, and also possibly, the R button. They can all do different things, like the bald freak who can change shape into a birdie or an enemy. Stuff like that. It would be a really cool thing to have in a game, but unfortunately this game isn't very good anyways, so there you go.

In the year 1991, a powerful oil-rich dictator in the Middle-East has waged war on the world. You must navigate a super-modified Nuclear Apache Helicopter, D-FORCE, through six countries and infiltrate the enemy's headquarters. If the ol' apple pie and baseball are to remain as symbols of our country, you'd better get on the ball.

And we're not talk'n about your everyday dinosaurs either; there are helicopter eating creatures that could bring about your true test of non-stop, creative thinking.

'Course you'll have the latest weapons at your side. And the farther you go, the more you'll get a chance to use them. If you are able to conquer the seemingly endless enemies, watch out for the... we're losing you... your radio's breaking up... good luck, you're on your own!

Your chopper blades are spinning - there's no turning back! Never fear, you're in command of the ultimate weapon, D-FORCE!

Thousand of years ago, Proco and Tiat escaped from the planet Darius which had been invaded by Belser. The descendants of Proco and Tiat established the Federation of the Galaxy on the planet Orga. But now Belser's evil alliance on Darius has resumed its aggressive invasion. After a millennium, our hero fighters are prepared to launch into battle in their Silver Hawks.

That was the story found in the intro of the game.

I have enjoyed this game for a while. Even though it's not Gradius or R-Type-quality, it does its job. The only thing that bothers me is that most of the enemies look like fish. I hope you get a friend to try the two-player simultaneous mode!

Directions:

Save the planet Darius from invasion! 

When you start, you have three options: "1 Player", "2 Player", and "Option". When you select "1 Player" or "2 Player", the game begins. Throughout this "fishy" shoot-em-up, you will see several weak enemies that just come after you and ones that fire missiles. Some of them drop power-ups, including weapon upgrades and shields. But beware of the bosses, which can turn you into "dinner" after a few shots. After each level, you get to choose your path from where you are. "Options" from the main menu lets you adjust your lives, toggle rapid fire, listen to the music in the game, and change your difficulty.

Dark Law: Meaning of Death
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game , Turnbased , Fantasy
Release Year: 2007
Original Title: Dark Law: Meaning of Death
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
Dark Law is the sequel to Dark Lord, the third part in a trilogy of tangentially-related games (think Soul Blazer/Illusion of Gaia/Terranigma.) Whereas the second game in the series, Wizap!, kind of stinks, Dark Law is fully of all kinds of awesome. Combat plays similarly to Treasure Hunter G, if you?ve played that, except it?s not grid based - you have a power bar that decreases as you move, and the more it has left in it the more attacks you can make in a single turn. It?s also got multiple endings!

Dark Law is essentially the Japanese interpretation of the pencil-and-paper RPG into a videogame format. The focus is rather heavy on exploration and light on combat, with copious amounts of storytelling thrown in for good measure. It, like Dark Lord before it, is told through a series of short stories ("Scenarios") which tie together by the final conclusion. It's a pretty cool game, on the whole.

Translation Description:

Gideon Zhi picked this up from Haeleth and completed it. There's a lot of low level hacking that went into this and it shows. So check it out.

Also, the game's font is hi-res, which is why the screenshots up top are blurry.

"Pure torture. But wortha look for sheer curiosity"

When this first came out I was astounded at the screenshots....I had never seen anything like it. I bought it,,,,then I realised why I have never seen anything like it since.

GRAPHICS

Well, ambitious is the word that describes this game. Huge foreground sprite which for its time is well done I guess.

The courts are clear, with the odd nice touch here and there. Animation is quite lifelike for the era, yet is difficult to see for the far end of the court, the view is obstructed by the net, thanks to the low down view point.

Which leads nicely into...

GAMEPLAY

The games ambitiousness is its downfall really. It plays a reasonable game of tennis, but the viewpoint does make it very very hard to get into. You can just about learn how to give the ball a nice thwack, but a crosscourt shot from you means the camera swinging to the left, say, to follow the ball. You must use your own sense of direction to figure out where you are and where you should be heading to receive the next shot.

If you are good at games you will learn this, but it really goes against the whole object of playing it on tv....the whole point is you are meant to SEE your character. It happens too often to describe it as a minor fault. You literally have to master this INVISIBLE technique to win matches.

This happens much less frequently on SUPER TENNIS. However, Super Tennis is about 100 times more intuitive than this game, and you ALWAYS know where you are on that game, so it is much more forgivable.

Things get worse down the other end. MAintaining a baseline rally when playing at the far end is very hard. You cannot judge how far in you are standing, which often leads to missed shots or simple mis-hits.

You have to learn a formula.....return his serve then just charge the net. That way at least your player becomes more visible. You just have to worry about hitting away a good volley or smash,,,(not easy..but learnable..just!)

Overall, the whole thing becomes a stressful experience rather than a fun one. It IS possible to have a few decent rallies, but you will need to practice a LOT. Some may think itis not worth it. I think it is, just to able to say that you mastered it.

Long matches with high ranked players can turn out to be very long indeed, but you do start to feel anxious to win, since you have to put in so much effort. I felt happy many times when finally beating SVEN for example in a 3 set match. It's quite exhausting to keep up with the techniques necessary to win a match.

CONCLUSION

Well, if you are a sucker for punishment, get this tennis game! Seriously, although a bit primitive, the ball control IS fair and CAN offer a decent game of tennis, albeit limited. However, you will need to put a lot of work in.

It is a curious game of tennis indeed.

_________________________

Christmas is a time where people get together and give others presents and spend all day eating food. But there's only one problem this year. You see, while Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold and evil snowman spooked all the elves away, and the Timekeeper has stolen Santa's plans from his house. There won't be any Christmas if Santa doesn't stop them.

In Daze Before Christmas, you're Santa. According to the game's Christmas calender, you have 24 areas to explore such as factories, workshops, caves, and more. Each area is filled with nasty enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes, helicopters, snowmen, and many others. Furthermore, after every five areas, Santa has to come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, The Timekeeper, and Louse the Mouse, but also Mr. Weather.

Santa's health is represented by five Santa hats. When Santa is hit by any one of his enemies, one hat is lost. If Santa loses all of his hats, then he will lose a life. He will then have to restart at the beginning of the area, unless he passes a gold bell somewhere in the area. When you explore each area, Santa can collect presents that contain a mini-Santa (aka: Extra Life), a red hat, or he may release an elf. Santa should be careful when opening these presents as some of them may contain bombs or other enemies. If Santa manages to find a spinning star, he must get it as this will take him to the next area.

Santa kills his enemies by throwing magic at them. In almost each area, Santa can get a cup of hot cocoa. Doing this will transform him into Anti-Santa, a type of Santa who wears nothing but white, grows Satan's horns on top of his head, is invincible, and comes equipped with a hammer in which he can use to bonk enemies with. The Anti-Santa business only lasts for 20 seconds, but this can be changed via the Options menu.

Daze acts like one of those platform games where you run through the level, shoot at enemies, and proceed to the exit. However, there are some areas where the gameplay changes, and these areas involve Santa flying through the sky in England, Russia, Japan, and the USA, and dropping presents in chimneys to score points. The game also uses a password-saving system, where entering a password given will allow gamers to restart at the beginning of a specific area, in case they happen to run out of lives.

Demolition Man
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Movie Adaption
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Virgin Interactive
Publisher: Acclaim
_________________________
*
Demolition Man is a multiplatform, run and gun action game based on the film of the same name. The player controls the main character, John Spartan as he attempts to find and defeat his arch-nemesis, Simon Phoenix. Even though he is the final boss of the game, the player has to fight him in teaser battles before defeating him for good at the cryo-prison.

Two different views are used within the game. Some stages are platform game type in side view, and include jumping and climbing, while other stages take an overhead top-down shooter view; in all stages the player character can fire in eight directions. Stages are filled with many enemies, mostly gunmen. Enemy characters and the player character can take a number of hits before dying. Power ups can be found around the stages that increase the characters health or ammunition. The game gives the player limited continues and very few lives. The first stage is set in 1996 and all stages after in 2032, following a simplified plot of the movie. In the two overhead view stages the player must find and rescue hostages in order to unlock further into the level.

Weapons include the basic pistol, the basic rifle, rapid-fire machine gun, grenades, among others. Losing a life can occur through being shot to death, being crushed to death, being thrown off the train, accidentally getting frozen by Simon Phoenix's cryogenic gun, and falling into a pit of lava.

Comparisons Between the Game and the Movie:

This emasculation of the movie eliminates all of the comedic elements and turns the game into a straight action game with minor witty comments that appeared on the Super NES and the Sega Genesis versions of the game. Examples of these minor witty comments included statements like "you look great today" and "avoid fatty foods." Hardcore fans of the movie would eventually find out that the "talking computer" can only utter MDK repeatedly in the game. Even with this limitation in mind, the game can keep track of the player's score and how many people he has killed. Due to the game's Kids-to-Adults rating, there is no adult language as seen in the movie. When players see the machines that gave out fines for "violating the verbal morality stature" in the movie, they are considered to be mere decorations in the video game.

The first level is displayed in side view platform type, the health bar is displayed in the bottom left. John Spartan enters the stage by jumping with a cable from a helicopter, a scene taken from the movie

All references to Taco Bell have been eliminated because the Taco Bell restaurant is part of a side story involving Raymond Cocteau, Lenina Huxley, and John Spartan; it has nothing to do with the main quest of apprehending Simon Phoenix. The gunmen in the game are assumed to belong to Edgar Friendly; the movie mentions about a resistance army in the sewers rebelling against Raymond Cocteau's control of San Angeles. Simon Phoenix does not gather an army of his own until late in the movie and Edgar Friendly is the only one who has the charisma to recruit a mass number of gunmen from the start of the 2032 (future) segment of the film. There is also another stage that was never in the movie; the maglev train level. In this level, John Spartan must navigate through a futuristic train. He must try to avoid either getting killed by the thugs or the devices controlled by the train's central processing unit. The object of that level was to stop the train before it went uncontrollably fast. 

The futuristic parking lot level introduced a robotic villain that was never seen in the film; a renegade car crusher that attacked the player with automobiles.

And yes, to say that this game is similar to Sweet Home would be quite an understatement. Regardless, the game's pretty fun, and features a cute and adorable player-character girlie. If you choose the "girlie" option, that is. And who wouldn't?

Everything is translated, but there are way too many bugs for this to be classified as a "Complete" translation. If you disagree, just try and fight a battle. It is completely playable, though, if you know what all the commands and stuff are.

A Legend of Two Realms

Many, many years ago it was a time of fantasy and intrigue. Legends passed from generation to generation. People loved to spin takes of great warriors rising up against the tyrannical forces of those who ruled.

One such legend spoke of a world that was once divided into two different lands. The two realms existed in harmony: one ruled by humans, the other ruled by demons. There was rarely conflict between the two realms until one fateful day.

Six magical stones fell from the sky into the demon's realm. Inscribed on the stones were the Crests of Fire, Earth, Air, Water, Time and Heaven. These crests, when united, would grant unimaginable power.

Soon the demons began to fight over these magical crests. The demon realm erupted into civil war. The land was in turmoil over the stones until finally one red demon emerged with five stones by defeating the others. This demon was known as Firebrand.

Firebrand was not satisified that possessing the Crests of Fire, Earth, Air, Water and Time would end the war.

He then challenged the Demon Dragon for the Crest of Heaven. After a long and desperate battle, Firebrand slayed the Dragon and gained the final Crest. But the price of victory was high. Firebrand was critically wounded.

Firebrand also did not realize that while he was obtaining the Crests, his success only moved him closer to failure. The jealous demon Phalanx secretly trailed Firebrand and waited for just the right moment.

"I have defeated the Red Demon!" Phalanx cried. "I shall reign supreme! With the power of the Crest, both the demon world and the human world are mine!"

Firebrand vowed revenge on Phalanx. Phalanx was clever, though. He separated the crests in case someone did rise up to challenge the power he possessed.

And now someone has risen to the challenge. The legend of Firebrand is about to unfold in the search of the Demon's Crest!

--From the SNES Demon's Crest instruction manual.

Overview:

Demon's Crest is a continuation of the Gargoyle's Quest series, which takes place in the Ghoul Realm, the opposite side of the human world. It's also where Ghosts 'n Goblins was set, when a demon kidnapped Princess Guinivere and took her there. The graphics are excellent, still in keeping with the style and theme of this great classic series. Demon's Crest departs from the Adventure/RPG style of Gargoyle's Quest. The game-play is more action oriented, similar to Ghosts 'n Goblins.

_________________________

Before the actual playing takes place, Dennis has just discovered that he left Mr. Wilson's door unlocked, and a thief has stolen Mr. Wilson's entire coin collection. Dennis must retrieve all of the coins before Mr. Wilson finds out. The games starts out in Mr. Wilson's house, in which there are 4 main coins that must be found. However, there are smaller coins which do not affect gameplay, only score. Once the four main coins are found, the final coin (which cannot be attained until the previous 4 coins are found) is touchable, leading Dennis onto the next stage. The next set of stages are given titles, with the naming process being as such: "Name #", replacing "Name" with the title of the set, and "#" with the subsequent level of the set (up to 6).

The same coin-collection game is present throughout the rest of the game (with the exception of two stages in the first park stage set, wherein Dennis must traverse the park on a wagon led by his dog). After each sixth level, there is a boss stage, followed by a new set of levels. The sets of levels are, in order, Mr. Wilson's House, Park, Boiler Room, Sewers, and finally, Woods. The end of the woods levels, and the subsequent beating of the final boss, marks the end of the game.

Der Langrisser
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game , Strategy , Turnbased
Release Year: 2008
Original Title: Der Langrisser
Translated By: byuu, D
Version: 1.02
_________________________
*
Der Langrisser, the translation that took 6 years to finish, is one of the most grand translations to hit the translation community in years. After two failed attempts to translate this game, it was challenged, faced, and finished by Byuu and D-Boy.

To start off, Der Langrisser is the SNES version of Langrisser 2 for Sega Genesis. The player at the start gets to choose a set of answers per questions. Up to 18 questions are total but depending on your answers different questions will be asked. These questions decide what class your character will be at the start of the game, items, and stats. However, these may affect later choices by the character in the game.

At the start, the player goes through 7 battles. Then, choices are made of what path the player wishes to follow. The Light Path, that is very straight through minus a choice of characters and the Imperial path. The Imperial path also can split into 2 further paths, the Dark path or the Independent Path. So, people can see, there is extremely strong replay value within the game. Yet, there are choices characters can make as well.

Characters have different paths that can take after hitting level 10. They are able to split down different paths to become more like fighters, horsemen, priests, casters, and other medieval classes an individual can think about within the game. The further the players level and change class, the stronger spells, stats, and troops they can use. Allowing for players to make characters to how they wish their characters to be.

This translation was one of my long awaited. There's so much I wish I could say, yet I don't wish to destory the fun of the game for people. If there is one game for the SNES that never made it to US shores that people have to play, this is it.

Translation Description:

After 6 years, the team around byuu and D finally released their long awaited "Der Langrisser" translation. It features extensive ASM modifications (over 85kb of new code!)and several custom fonts which were specifically designed to look best on a real TV. Every menu window in the game has been custom tuned as well.

The effort that went into this translation really shows - so go ahead and play this.

Tips:

Multimedia Test
Go to the Load menu and place your cursor on any save slot, with a save in it. Press left, right, select, A

Scenario Select
Go to the Load menu and place your cursor on any save slot, with a save in it. Press up, down, up, down, left, right, select, A

Shop 2
On the Buy screen, press Left, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up, Left, Select, Down, Right, Left, Select, A

Special Shop
Press Left, Right, Right, Down, Right, Up, and A while highlighting the 'Buy' command.

Cloning Items
his trick allows you to duplicate any item. (Even limited items such as Langrisser or Runestones). The limitation is that the cloned item will have to stay equipped.  To start, equip said character with desired item to clone. Beat a scenario. Save the game, and go back to the load menu.  Scenario Select back to a scenario where said character
appears as a NPC.  You'll still have the item the character equipped in your inventory. This is the cloned item. Equip that item to whoever you want. This action will swap the cloned item with the real item. Now, once you start the
scenario, the NPC will be holding the cloned item, and the real item will be equipped to whichever character you gave it to.  Once the NPC joins your party, the NPC will retain the cloned item.  Make sure you don't unequip the cloned item, or it will disappear.  

Inventory Trick
When a character class changes, he or she still retains any items equipped. You can use this to your advantage. For
example, say your Elwin started as a Fighter.

Fighters can equip Speedboots, but Knights can't. If Elwin has speedboots equipped and class changes to SlvrKnt, he will still have the speedboots equipped, even though SlvrKnt cannot equip speedboots.

(Hint: You can use this trick in conjunction with Runestones and Scout classes to equip ranged weapons.)

Secret Scenarios

Secret Scenario 1:
On Scenario 6, place Elwin at the upper left corner of the map on the spot where the wall juts in a little bit more and kill all enemies. You will be given the option to investigate the Muscular Shrine. Say yes to access the secret level.

Secret Level 2 & 3:
On Scenario 8, place Elwin at the bottom right corner of the map where there is a small pool with a stick sticking out of it and kill all enemies. Depending on whether you're in the Light or Imperial path, you'll go to either Secret Scenario 2 or 3 

Starting Items Trick
When saying 'No' to 'Is this okay?' during character creation, all stats are reset except starting Items. Doing this, you can obtain many items from the start of the game such as Devil axes, saleable for lots of P. Though after the 6th time, the game freezes. So don't get too greedy.

A year after the Gulf war, American troops are returning to deal with a madman named General Mubaba, who intends to possibly destroy the world. So the president of the United States of America (supposedly Bill Clinton) Decides to hire the best chopper pilots to fly into the gulf of Persia to deal with the madman. You're the main pilot. You have a choice of 4 co-pilots. Lt. "X-man" Thomas, Lt. "Aussie" Tinmarie, Lt. "Mr. D" Arrick, and Lt. "Tracker" Michaels. There's also a pilot who's MIA, so you have to find him as well. Are you good enough to take on the whole Middle east to take down this madman?

This is EA at it's finest. EA always makes great music, no matter what video game you play. The sound effects are excellent, the graphics are like candy to the eyes, and the controls are as beautiful as they come. You pretty much choose what buttons do what, and how you control the chopper. Overall, this game is a keeper.

Directions:

You must complete missions to make your way towards the madman, Mubaba. You get 3 lives, 8 Hellfires, 34 Hydras, and 1178 bullets. You fly your Apache helicopter over the desert to kill enemy soldiers and to blow up AA guns, Rapiers, Tanks, and the like. You also destroy buildings such as power plants, radar sites, control centers, airfields, and a whole lot more. But you're bound to run out of ammo and fuel sometime, so look around for barrels of fuel and ammo boxes. Use the winch to hook them up. Also, pick up MIA's, POW's, and other people. Even with all that, you have a difficult task ahead of you. Pilot your chopper right, and maybe, just maybe, you'll come out alive with the madman in your hands.

This game is at its heart a dungeon crawler. You walk around dungeons in a first-person perspective and fight monsters. But you don't necessarily have to fight them, oh no! You can also talk to them. If they don't like what you have to say they'll start attacking you, or get a buddy to help kill you, or just ignore you altogether. If they DO like what you're saying, they can give you money, or even join your party, or they can just leave you alone. You can even fuse the minions you recruit to create new, more powerful minions. Very open-ended stuff.

The plot is crazy and fantastic, taking place in modern-day Japan, and involving a group of people who want to summon the god of Law to Earth so he can rule us all and everything will be orderly and, therefore, happy. Then there's this bunch of guys who want to stop this from happening, and try to summon the god of Chaos who will give everyone free will, making everyone, again, happy. It's your job to choose sides, which determines the outcome: Law or Chaos. Or you can choose neither, and kick everyone's ass. Kinda hard to do though.

While the graphics aren't astounding, they're merely a backdrop to the neat gameplay and storyline. At least the artwork's good though. Some of those demons look super cool.

Translation Description:

A lot of people seem to have trouble patching the game. It's really easy guys, just make sure you use the version 1.0 rom, and that the rom has a header. Okay? If you don't know how to check those, get SMC.COM from the FAQ page.

Also, the game seems to have random problems with crashing and such under ZSNES. SNES9x works fine though.

The translation for the game is excellent, and while there's the occasional hacking problem (overrunning and other such), there's nothing getting in the way of you having an enjoyable demon-summoning experience.

The Megami Tensei series is a long one, and mostly a Japanese one. Shin Megami Tensei II is a direct sequel to Shin Megami Tensei, and takes place a few decades afterwards. You're a guy who (of course) doesn't know who he is, and he's really strong and fights in the colosseum fights in Tokyo Millennium, a domed city that is essentially the last stronghold for humanity and whatnot. Soon he makes it to the championship battle, and shortly afterwards all hell breaks loose. LITERALLY! OMG hahahaha! You've never heard that one before, I warrant!

All you people who don't know what Megami Tensei is all about are pretty much cocking their head to one side and looking confused right about now. Maybe some further explanation is in order. I guess. The Shin Megami Tensei games take place in the distant future, where demons run rampant on the earth. Your advantage is your ability to talk to these demons and gain their trust. Ideally, they will join your party, and will fight alongside you and so forth. You can even fuse two or three demons to create an even more powerful demon. Pretty open-ended stuff, this.

Fans of the first Shin Megami Tensei will not find much different. Thank Jesus, accessing the map now only requires a press of the L button. And there are? other differences.

Translation Description:

Fortunately, SMT2 has gone through some extensive beta testing, and all that's left are some inconsequential bugs. Check the readme for specifics.

Not like the SMT1 beta, where hardly anyone bothered to even finish the game. Cough. What?!

Also be sure and check the awesome Tokyo Millennium Civilian's Passport included in the zip, for instructions on how to play, explanations of those damned spells, and etc.

DinoCity is a traditional platformer-style action game where the player must move their character from left to right across the screen while avoiding obstacles, jumping on platforms, and defeating enemies.[1] Players are given the choice of controlling Rex with Timmy or Tops with Jamie at the beginning of the game as well as at the start of each new level. While Tops can throw darts to damage enemies from a distance, Rex is confined to close combat by punching them or swinging his tail.[2] Each dinosaur character can defeat enemies by jumping on them, and at any point the player may relegate control to their human riders, who can freeze enemies in place by using a special energy device. While controlling the children, the dinosaurs become immobile and may be used as platforms themselves to reach otherwise inaccessible items. The game supports up to two players who are given alternating turns at play each time the other loses a life.

In order to pass each of the game's six levels, players must navigate through a number of screens joined by doors. Each screen resembles a different environment, and can include caves, jungles, grasslands, or ice caverns. Once a player has passed enough screens they must battle a boss character before advancing. If a character loses enough lives, they are given the option to continue up to three times before the game is over. During gameplay a player may collect eggs which grant an extra life if enough are obtained, as well as hearts that restore lost health. The game utilizes a password system that allows players to return to the start of any level from the title screen.

Although this soccer game is based on Goal, it features a very different control method, with the ball on sticking to your foot to make running with the ball easier. The game is viewed from above and played up and down the pitch, without the left-to-right option of Goal. Matches can be between 2 or 20 minutes, and the scanner which shows player positions on the rest of the pitch can be moved, resized or disabled. The method of triggering aftertouch onto a pass can be chosen as well.

The game features a variety of tournaments, including the full World Cup and its qualifying rounds, and the European Championships, or individual matches, as well as being able to configure a league or cup tournament ot your own specification. Only international teams are included, although their names can be customised. Unlike most soccer games of the time, player ethnicities are accurately depicted.

Dirt Trax Fx is a Motocross racing game in which players can choose between 8 drivers, differing in top speed, acceleration, turning and braking, to compete on 22 different tracks. The tracks feature lots of mounds, ramps, pits and other similar obstacles. Parts of a track might also be covered in water mud or ice. To successfully navigate the motorbike through these obstacles, the shoulder buttons can be used to lean the bike, while pressing up or down changes the angle of the bike. Before the game begins, players can choose between four different bikes ranging from 50cc to 500cc (the last bike needs to be unlocked first). The choice of the bike greatly affects the game's speed as well as the overall difficulty.

Apart from the main race, there is also a "Rad Tag" mode. In this mode, a timer ticks down that can only be stopped by hitting the opponent. The driver whose timer reaches zero first loses.

For years the secret of the lamp has eluded me, but tonight it was within my grasp. At long last, I had succeeded in uniting the halves of the ancient golden scarab, which led me along a magical trail across the dunes. Taking the worthless thief, Gazeem, with me, I ventured deep into the desert. We watched in anticipation as the two pieces of the scarab split apart and buried themselves deep in the sand. This was what I had searched for!

Suddenly, the ground began to quake under us and a huge tiger's head rose ominously from the moonlit sands. I had found it! After all the searching - The Cave of Wonders!

I sent Gazeem into the tiger's mouth with instructions to bring me the lamp. As I watched him draw closer to the cave, I could feel the power of the lamp. But I was unprepared for what happened next...

The Cave itself rose in anger and rejected Gazeem, silencing him forever with its massive stone jaws. 'Only one who is worthy may enter,' it roared. 'One whose rags hide a heart that is pure. A diamond in the rough...'

Somewhere I will find this diamond and then the power of the lamp will be mine!

--From the SNES Aladdin instruction manual.

Overview:

Here's a game based on a story most of us know and love. The game comes really close to the movie. I'd compare this to the recent Prince of Persia games with all the acrobatics you'll be performing. Also, for those of you who have played Kingdom Hearts, you'll notice that Agrabah is very similar in appearance to the version in that game. It looks really good. The colors are rich and really do justice to this jewel-studded story. The music is appropriately exotic and sound effects are fun and creative.

While, as a general rule, I'm not a big fan of movies turned into games, this one is pretty good. The game stays true to the movie to a satisfying extent and, in itself, is lots of fun. The moves Aladdin performs are diverse and the game will really hold your attention.

Directions:

Aladdin is quite an athletic lad, he can bounce off of enemies' heads, swing on posts, and grab onto ledges. To grab onto a ledge, just jump towards it. If you are close enough, Aladdin will grab on automatically.

Then press up to pull yourself up or down to drop off. Duck things like arrows and bats by pressing down.

Aladdin is also good at throwing his apples, which can stun enemies for a deadly jump on the head. Jumping on an enemy's head isn't the only way to defeat them. Swing into them while swinging on a pole and you'll take them out as well.

Believe in Aladdin's prowess. When it looks like he can't reach something or make it to that next ledge, have a little faith. He more than likely can make that impossible looking jump. He may just need a running start or a bit of a boost. Get extra height when bouncing off of something you have jumped onto by holding B down. Also, try bouncing off of everything, people leaning out of windows, poles, jars... you never know what might be bounceable.

Sometimes things you bounce will have stuff inside. Pick up loaves of bread and chicken to restore Aladdin's health. His health is displayed in the top left corner of the screen in hearts. As he takes damage these will turn from red to black. You'll have a moment when Aladdin is flashing where he'll be invincible after taking damage. Take advantage of this moment if you can. If all the hearts are gone, you lose a life. If you find a red sphere with a heart on it, Aladdin's total health will be increased by one heart. Find a gold lamp and you'll get an extra life. You can also find apples inside of things.

You can find red jewels hidden throughout the game. These are mostly in hard to reach places or gotten by doing something a bit unusual and are worth more than the green ones. Normal green gems are more abundant. If you collect 100 gems you'll earn an extra heart! Find and catch the golden scarab and you'll be taken to a special bonus game at the end of the stage where you spin a wheel and get whatever it lands on. Stars are extra credits (continues), 1 and 2 extra man slots are on the wheel, the heart is an extra man, and you get an extra heart for ending on genie's face (unless you already have the maximum amount, then you get 3 extra men!).

At the end of every stage you'll have to face a bad guy that will take more hits to kill and more strategy to defeat. In the first stage it's the sword-swinging hothead that has princess Jasmine. Apples won't do much good against this guy. Wait for him to swing his sword (of course, you'll have to let him get close before he'll do that) and he'll leave himself vulnerable for a moment. Now you can bounce him. After that, he'll swing his sword in an angry frenzy. Jump onto the overhang to get out of the way. Other bosses will progress in a similar fashion. Figure out the best pattern to beat each one. 

Controls:

A Button - Throw Apple
B Button - Jump
X Button - Nothing
Y Button - Run
L Button - Nothing
R Button - Glide (need white rug)
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Nothing

Hints:

Special Ending
Finish the game with at least 70 red gems, and you'll get to see the Special Ending.

Level Select
Highlight Options and press start. Now with controller 2 press L, R, Start, Select, X, Y, A, B.

Easy Lives
When genie blinks in the Bonus Game, stop the wheel. You will get a 1-up or a 2-up.

On a great day for fishing in Spoonerville, Goofy and his son Max go out to the sea. While fishing, they see a huge pirate boat heading towards Spoonerville with Pete and PJ kidnapped. Goofy tries to catch up with the boat, but doesn't succeed until the boat lands on the pirate's island.

Upon landing on the island and defeating a group of pirates, Goofy and Max learn that the pirates have mistaken Pete for their captain, Keelhaul Pete, who had been swallowed by a whale a long time ago. As Goofy and Max explore of the island and fighting more pirates, Pete and PJ keep up the misconception, as Pete enjoys being the pirate king.

Eventually, Goofy and Max reach the pirate's ship, and see what appears to be Pete. Goofy attempts to save him, but accidentally knocks him out. Max then realizes that the person they assumed to be Pete is actually the real Keelhaul Pete, having returned after the whale spat him out. Concerned with the safety of their neighbors, Goofy and Max infiltrate the pirate ship, climaxing with another run-in with Keelhaul Pete. After defeating him, they find Pete and PJ about to be fed to an alligator, and they promptly rescue them (after Goofy questions why the alligator is trying to eat them before dinner time). Suspending Keelhaul Pete over the alligator in their place, Goofy, Max, Pete, and PJ return to their fishing trip.

Gameplay:

Playing as Goofy or Max, the player works through five areas on Spoonerville island: on the beach, in a village under siege, a haunted castle, a mountain valley, and finally the pirate's ship where Pete and PJ are held captive.

To defend against enemies, players can throw flowerpots, barrels or vases. There exist several items in the game; for example, a bell to bait the pirates. In the multiplayer game, players can bait enemies into positions where the other player can easily kill them. A grappling hook can be used to stun enemies or for collecting health points, represented as bananas and cherries; only one item can be carried by each player in multiplayer mode, and two in singleplayer mode. Players get an extra life for collecting a red diamond, and an extra continue for a white one.

The game is very puzzle-oriented. Goofy and Max can kick stones which slide until they are stopped by a barrier. Goofy and Max must place stones on switches to open doors. They also search for grappling hooks with which they can use to stretch a line over an abyss, or wooden shelves to repair a destroyed bridge. In this situation, the items are lost afterwards. In addition, they must search for keys to open the path to the levels' bosses.

From time to time, Goofy and Max meet Islander, who gives them information about treasures on the island or clues about how to solve problems.

The game includes a password system that enables players to start directly in one of the four advanced stages.

The game is a side-scrolling platform game, with the controlled character having to leap, climb, run and descend from platform to platform. There is an exception during the level The Stampede, where Simba is running towards (or in the NES and Game Boy versions, running with the camera looking straight down on top of him) the camera dodging wildebeest and leaping over rocks.

In most versions of the game two bars appear on the HUD. To the left is the roar meter, which must be fully charged for Simba's roar to be effective. To the right is the health bar which decreases when Simba is hurt. At the bottom left of the screen is a counter showing how many lives Simba has remaining. Health can be restored by collecting bugs which come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some rare health-damaging bugs also exist.

The player controls Simba (first as a cub, then later as an adult) in the main levels and either Timon or Pumbaa in the bonus levels.

This is a nice cutesy little platform game. I know that the SNES had about fifteen thousand different platform games, but this one is a lot better than most, let me tell you something. It's kind of generic, but in that "good-generic-platformer" kind of way. The graphics are good, and it's fun to play. What the hell else do you want?

Translation Description:

For some reason, the Gaijin website has the version 0.98 patch on their site, and not this one. This was put out a few months later and fixes some text bugs.

Anyways, there's not much text in this game, so all that got translated pretty quick. Some signs are still in Japanese though, due to the graphics being compressed.

Addendum Version:

This is a Complete Translation for Do-Re-Mi Fantasy for Snes. It is based on Gaijin Translations 2000 Translation Patch for the Dialogue text, and this patch includes all of the Graphics Translated including Title Logo, World Names, Menus and Mini Game Text. Some improvements have also been made to the dialogue text to make it more consistent and to fix some errors.

IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NITE...

Storms lashed the rugged terrain of Donkey Kong Island, home of the famous video game ape and his family and friends. Near Donkey Kong's tree house, a small monkey named Diddy cowered in fear of the savage lightning which periodically illuminated the lush, dark jungle that covered most of the island. Donkey Kong had assigned Diddy to guard duty on this awful night, and he was not happy about his fate.

Donkey Kong's earlier pep talk kept creeping back into Diddy's mind. "Ok, little buddy," Donkey had said in his patronizing voice. "As part of your hero training, you've got to stand guard tonight over my bananas... I'll relive you at midnight, so try and stay awake until then!"

Buddy? Yeah, right. Now he was alone. Alone unless you counted the unknown threats which lurked behind every tree that he glimpsed during the lightning flashes. The Kremlings were out there, this much was certain. They coveted Donkey Kong's banana stockpile, the largest on the island, and probably in the world. A treasure in potassium and Vitamin A. The perfect food. "Ahhh... delicious bananas..." The thought of DK's golden horde almost made Diddy forget his uncomfortable situation. But a rustling in the under- growth and the sound of several snapping twigs brought him out of his reverie.

"W-w-who goes there?!" Diddy challenged the sounds in the darkened, dripping foliage. There was no answer but the flashing of claws and teeth, followed by a fleeting vision of many reptilian eyes and a crack of thunder. Diddy somersaulted into the fray with his signature cartwheel attack, but he was quickly overcome by the weight of many scaly assailants. The enormous bulk of Klump the Kremling landed on top of Diddy, knocking him senseless. His last memory was of a hissing voice..."It'ssss the sssmall one... Ssseal him inssside thisss barrel and tosss it into the bussshesss... Donkey Kong'sss bananasss are ourssss!" The barrel lid closed on Diddy, blotting out even the fleeting light of the storm. Seconds later, the barrel flew through the air, courtesy of Klump's army boot-assisted punt, and landed roughly in the jungle foliage. Diddy Kong knew no more.

The entire Donkey Kong clan was oblivious as the Kremlings then loaded the banana horde into their Kremling karts and wheeled them off through the jungle, leaving an obvious trail of dropped fruit from their overloaded conveyances.

The next morning, Donkey Kong was awakened by frantic shouting of his name. "Keep it down!!" he growled. He suddenly realized what time it was. "Morning already... I slept through my watch!" Falling out of bed and through his tree house door, Donkey Kong slid down the tree house ladder without using any of the rungs, and assumed his characteristic fighting pose, with sun-blinded, squinting eyes! One swift blow was all that was needed to leave him sprawled on the floor, face down! he groggily rolled over to see the familiar wrinkled, white-bearded, grouchy face of his old granddad "Cranky Kong" peering down at him. In his heyday, Cranky was the original Donkey Kong who battled Mario in several of his own games.

"What 'cha do that for?!" Donkey Kong asked, knowing full well that Cranky was prone to cuffing him at every whim.

"Take a look inside your banana cave. You're in for a big surprise!" Cranky crackled.

Donkey's mind raced as he vaulted to the cave and peered inside. Instead of the dull golden glow of thousands of bananas, there were only a few discarded peels. These had been trampled into the dirt by hundreds of reptilian feet, judging from the many three-toed footprints that covered the damp cavern floor. But what about...

"Diddy's gone, too!" Cranky laughed. "That's what you get for shirking your responsibility, you good-for-nothing bum! In my days we would have been happy to stand guard in the rain, 'cause that might have meant having an extra frame of animation! Of course, having rain would have been impossible, given our pitiful processing power, but..."

Donkey Kon stood there in stunned disbelief and hadn't heard most of what Cranky said. "Diddy... gone... My little buddy..." he murmured to himself.

Donkey Kong was suddenly filled with conviction. "The Kremlings will pay!" he raged. "I'll hunt them down through every corner of my island, until I have every last banana from my horde back!!"

"Find your little buddy and retrieve a bunch of bananas?!" Cranky snorted. "What kind of game idea is that?! Where's the screaming damsel in distress?!"

"Diddy's obsession with being like me has gone too far! He may be a long way from being a true video game hero, but he had the guts, the reflexes, the heart..."

"If you ask me, neither of you are ready for prime time," Cranky interrupted. "You'll never be as popular a character as I was! Why, in my heyday, kids lined up to play my games! The quarters were stacked on the machine as they waited for their turn! If you go on this ridiculous adventure, you'll be lucky to sell ten copies!"

Donkey Kong fumed. He usually let Cranky's rambling roll off his back, but this time was different. "What do you know about adventure, you flea-bitten old ape?" yelled Donkey Kong, edging closer and closer, braving Cranky's cane, until he was totally in his face. "I'm sick of hearing about your boring, single screen adventures! Diddy's in trouble, my banana horde is gone, and I'm going to get them all back!"

Donkey Kong stormed off in search of his missing buddy, following the trail of bananas the Kremlings had dropped.

"Well, it's not exactly rescuing a Princess, but it'll do in a pinch," Cranky snorted as DK disappeared into the lush jungle. After a moment's hesitation, Cranky followed him. "The lad may just need my help..." he mumbled to himself. "Kids today... they just don't have any respect for their elders..."

--From the SNES Donkey Kong Country instruction manual.

Overview:
Uh oh! The evil King K. Rool has stolen all the bananas from the Kong's Banana horde! It's up to DK and Diddy to get them back.

Donkey Kong Country was the start of a long and illustrious series for Nintendo. This series grew to be one of the most popular Donkey Kong games. The graphics looked really good on the SNES. The music was a pleasure as well. If you like Donkey Kong, give this game a try!

Directions:

Donkey Kong:
Donkey Kong's girth slows him down slightly, but he'll do more damage with his jump. He can also perform the Hand Slap by pressing down and B.

Diddy Kong:
Diddy is faster, and can jump higher than DK, but his weight can be a disadvantage since he'll bounce off enemies in a less controlled manner. Diddy can not do the hand slap.

Both DK and Diddy can roll into enemies to kill them.
Collect 100 Bananas for a 1-up
Collect a Balloon for a 1-up
Collect the K-O-N-G Letters for a 1-up 

Controls:

A Button - Switch Characters (When you have DK or Diddy following you)
B Button - Jump

Jump in mid-air.
This works in the stage, 'Mine Cart Carnage'. Hit the Star Barrel in the level, and then either die or pause and press 'Select'. Enter the stage again. When the Star Barrel explodes, IMMEDIATELY press Y and B simultaneously. You should now be jumping in the air, keep jumping by pressing Y and B in succession. You can use this glitch to jump all the way to the end of the stage.  NOTE: Do not backtrack to the beginning, as the glitch will stop functioning when you go back to the start.

Blast through mine cart carnage 
Near the beginning jump over the cannon and fall next to the wall underneath. You should get blasted out of a
cannon and sent in a cart almost all the way to the end of the level.

Infinite Bananas
In Bouncy Bonanza, after you obtain the frog, you will continuously be brought down this small path. If you
jump up, you will get three bananas. Now, enter the cave where you got the frog, and you will fall down again. The same three bananas are there! That means you can do this forever and you will get infinite bananas

Unlimited lives
To make this work you must use a save game. On your last life die as Diddy Kong. Then press start at the
screen. When Cranky Kong appears press down, Y, down, down, Y. You will be brought to a room with 3 of each golden animal. You can enter any of these bonus games as often as you like. To exit, just press start, then select. You will be brought back to the last place you died in your save game.

Warp past Stop & Go Station.
As soon as you start the level, walk left back into the entrance. You will warp to the end of the stage, where some maneuvering will get you past the level.

Trouble in Paradise

Donkey Kong gulped down the last of his banana milkshake and sighed happily, his old beach chair creaking as he wriggled his toes in the sand. "This is the life," he thought to himself. "The sun beating down on a clear blue sea, and no pesky banana-thieving Kremlings to worry about." Lazily he raised a hand to wave at Funky, who was showing off his surfing expertise out on the waves with the squawking seagulls.

Donkey Kong settled back and closed his eyes, thinking he'd have a little doze, when he heard the sound of shuffling feet. Before he knew what was happening, Cranky Kong bopped him on the head with his cane.

"Yowch!" he exclaimed, glaring at the snickering old ape standing in front of him.

"Well, well..." said Cranky, "what do you thing you're doing sitting around all day? They won't get much of a game out of this, will they? I thought you were supposed to be a big star!"

"Even stars get time off," muttered Donkey Kong, rubbing his head.

"I never did," said Cranky proudly. "Whisking off maidens and throwing barrels around the place seven days a week, I was. That's how I got where I am today, you know. Hard work. None of this lazing around on the beach."

"Why don't you go off and pester Diddy or something?" complained Donkey Kong. "Let me have a bit of peace for once!"

Cranky snorted. "Hah! He's off somewhere with that girlfriend of his. But still, I can see when I'm not wanted..."

Grumbling to himself, Cranky shambled off down the beach, leaving Donkey Kong to pull his hat over his eyes, sink down into his beach chair and slowly drift to sleep.

When night fell and their big buddy still hadn't returned, Diddy and Dixie Kong got worried and went to look for him. As they reached the beach, they saw hundreds of strange looking footprints that led from the sea to form a big circle around the spot where Donkey Kong's chair lay, smashed to pieces.

"Kremlings!" Diddy gasped in horror.

On top of the bits of chair they found a note:

     To the yellow-bellied, land-lubbing Kong Family:

     Hah-arrrrh!  We got the big monkey!

     If you want him back, you scurvy dogs,

     you'll have to hand over the banana hoard!

                   Kaptain K. Rool

"I thought we'd seen the last of that old rascal for a while," sighed Wrinkly Kong, Cranky's good-natured old wife, when the rest of the family had read the ransom note.

"Well," grunted Cranky, "I suppose we'd better give him the bananas, hadn't we?"

Diddy was shocked. "After all we did to get them back last time? Donkey Kong would go crazy if he lost his bananas again!"

[Cranky: Arrrrgh! This story's even worse than Donkey Kong Country! They're really scraping the bottom of the barrel this time!]

"Got any better ideas, you young whippersnapper?" demanded the old ape.

"We've got to rescue him, of course!" said Diddy and Dixie together.

But Cranky just laughed. "Oh, really? And who exactly is `we', hmmm?"

"Count me out, dudes," said Funky quickly, backing away from the group. "I hate adventures."

"I think I'm a bit old for that sort of thing," said Wrinkly apologetically.

"And I'm sure as spit not gonna do it," snapped Cranky. "Not that I'm past my prime, mind you--I could still do a better job than the rest of you put together--but I wouldn't be seen dead in a game that scrolls and has bonus levels and end bosses!"

"What about me?!" asked Diddy, stamping his foot. "I went with Donkey on his last adventure! Why can't I do it?!"

"You?" laughed Cranky. "You've only been in one game, and you didn't even get your name in the title! You think that makes you a hero?"

Diddy looked discouraged, but Dixie was quick to stand up for him. "Give him a chance--he could be a better hero than you ever were," she challenged.

Cranky scowled. "You think so, do you? You think he can make his way through all those Kremlings and all those traps, all by himself?"

"He won't be by himself," she replied. "I'm going with him!"

Diddy stared at her and she stared defiantly back.

"But it's dangerous!" he protested.

"You're not scared, are you?"

"Of course I'm not!"

"Well, neither am I. Don't try to argue--if you're going, I'm going with you."

Diddy sighed. He knew a hopeless argument when he saw one. But still, he was Donkey's only hope! Of course, if he managed to rescue his big buddy, he'd become a real video game hero, too! Could he ask for a better chance to prove himself?

Cranky was looking them over shrewdly. "All right," he said. "If you somehow get back safely from this and bring back that good-for-nothing Donkey with you, I'll admit that maybe you have what it takes after all. But if you don't, there will never be more than cheap cameo roles for you in the future, my boy."

Diddy stood up straight and proud, ready for his new quest. "I'll bring him back, you'll see!" he declared.

The others offered him encouragement. Wrinkly gave him a warm smile, while Funky offered his hand for a high-five. "Go for it, little dude!"

And as soon as the sun rose again, the brave young pair set out.

--From the SNES Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest instruction manual.

Overview:
This is the second installment in Nintendo's great Donkey Kong Country series. It had some pretty cool improvements, including the ability to throw your partner up to platforms that would be unreachable otherwise. Donkey Kong was one of Nintendo's first and biggest video games. Most people don't know this, but Nintendo is actually a couple hundred years old. They used to make board games and the like. Nintendo's business has been fun for a long time, and they sure do know what they're doing.

Directions:

Diddy Kong: Diddy's back, and he hasn't changed. He's still the fastest and highest jumper. 

Dixie Kong: Dixie is not as maneuverable as Diddy, but she has the helicopter spin, which slows her descent, making difficult jumps a breeze.

If you have Diddy and Dixie, you can have one grab the other and throw them to get hard to reach Items (A Button).
Different colored balloons give you different amounts of extra lives: Red=1; Green=2; Blue=3.
Collect 100 Bananas for an extra life, and collect K-O-N-G for another extra life.

There are three types of coins
DK Coins: Hidden coins with a mysterious purpose.
KremCoins: Get these from Bosses and Bonus Levels.
Banana Coins: Use these to buy stuff from the other Kongs.

2. Jump over the first two bananas, then collect the next bunch on top of the barrels. Still avoiding the first pair of bananas, return to the cabin and grab the balloon.
3. Jump over the first two bananas, then collect the next bunch on top of the barrels. Still avoiding the first pair of bananas, return to the cabin and grab the balloon.
4. Return to the cabin, still avoiding the first two bananas. You'll see a floating Kremcoin in the air.  Grab it to collect all 75 Kremlin Coins.

Trouble Again!

Months after their victory against King K. Rool and his army of baddies, the Kongs were still celebrating. Soaking up the sun in their favorite glade on DK Island, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong often slung up hammocks, hit the music and spent the day chilling out with banana milkshakes. If she couldn't think of anything better to do, Dixie Kong sometimes joined them.

This morning, though, Dixie was surprised to find Diddy's room deserted. Up and about so early? That wasn't like him. It was only as she turned to leave that she spotted the scribbled note on the table. "Gone exploring the islands with DK," it read. "Back tomorrow!" Dixie could remember at least three times that they'd already tried this plan. Each time, they'd never made it further than the beach. That's where she first went looking for them.

She realized well before she got to the beach that it was far too quiet for Donkey and Diddy to be anywhere near. Surely they hadn't followed one of their hare-brained schemes all the way through for once? The sun moved slowly across the sky and melted on the western horizon. Dixie hoped that her friends were having fun, wherever they were, as she settled into bed with a yawn.

When morning came again, another brief swing through the branches confirmed that Diddy was still off on his little expedition. Dixie found herself starting to worry. She could only imagine what kind of trouble Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were into. As the day crawled on and the night fell on the jungle, neither of the primates showed up. Again, Dixie could do nothing but head home to bed and hope that they'd be back by dawn.

The next day came, but neither Donkey nor Diddy returned. Dixie had to find out what those two primates were doing! She made her way to the southern part of DK Island and swan to the nearest mainland.

When she got there, she happened upon Wrinkly Kong's home. Wrinkly Kong told Dixie that the boys had passed by, but they hadn't said were they were going. She suggested that maybe the boys visited Funky Kong at his beach shop. As Dixie was leaving, Wrinkly asked if she'd look for the mysterious Banana Birds. The birds have been seen in the cave across from Funky's Rentals, but no one seems to know how to get them out. Dixie agreed and thanked Wrinkly for her help. She set out to see Funky at his shop.

Funky Kong was busy working on one of his inventions, and his shop was full of unusual items. He can find a use for anything that he gets his hands on. Funky told Dixie that the only visitor he's had all week was Kiddy Kong. Funky pointed across the room to the cuddly toddler who was chewing on an old spare tire. Funky asked Dixie if she wanted to take Kiddy with her. He's strong and can take good care of himself. Dixie agreed and the two were off. Before they left, Funky told them to keep their eyes peeled for some cool junk! He also told them to visit his friendly pals, the Brothers Bear, for help.

Once on their travels, Dixie and Kiddy discover a whole new collection of Kremlings who seem to have a new Master named KAOS.

--From the SNES Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! instruction manual.

Overview:

This game is one of the most fun in the Donkey Kong Country series. I really like the ability to throw Dixie Kong so high. The only thing I didn't like about Kiddy Kong is that he couldn't do the hand slap like Donkey Kong used to. For the most part this game was a lot of fun though. If you like the other Donkey Kong Country games give this one a try!

Directions:

Dixie Kong:
Dixie can still do her float move, and she's now the faster character of the duo. She will fly farther when thrown.

Kiddie Kong:
Kiddie doesn't have the hand slap, but other than that he's a lot like Donkey Kong. If Dixie throws him at about a 90 degree angle, he'll come slamming down with a force that can break weak floors. Kiddie can not be thrown as far or as high as Dixie can be.

Donkey Kong Country [Competition Edition]

_________________________

A very rare version of Donkey Kong Country was used in competitions such as the Nintendo PowerFest '94 and Blockbuster Video World Video Game Championship II (1995). The goal was to get as many points as possible before time ran out. Points could be gained by defeating enemies, throwing barrels, collecting bananas, collecting balloons, and collecting KONG letters. Many finalists in Nintendo's PowerFest tournament were given the cartridge. The carts used in the Blockbuster Video tournament were sold to Nintendo Power magazine subscribers through its Super Power Supplies Catalog in a plastic case labelled with the Blockbuster championship logo and some game artwork.

Doom on the PC was without a doubt my favorite first person shooter "back in the day," I just liked the entire concept of being a nameless marine and saving the Earth from the forces of Hell, which appeared through a portal on Mars. Yeah, it's a convoluted B-movie style plot, but when a game is this fun you tend to forgive the writers for not being H.G. Wells.

Doom makes the transition to the SNES without losing any of its atmosphere or fun in the process. The only thing that really disappointed me about this port was its lack of two-player, adversarial "Deathmatch," but even then, I still enjoy sitting back and tearing my way through the forces of Hell with nothing but a shotgun and my bare hands, and I have a feeling that you will too! The trademark MIDI soundtrack makes its way to the SNES intact, although the bass' volume has been brought up in the mix this time around, which may or may not annoy you (I honestly didn't mind). Like the sound, the graphics are mostly intact, except for being slightly more choppy and blurry due to the SNES' lower processing power, but even then, it's not like you'd notice that unless you've already played the PC version.

For my money, nothing beats Doom on the PC for classic shooting action, but this is still a great port to play if you can't get your hands on a copy, or just want to witness the evolution of one of gaming's most celebrated franchises.

Directions:

Doom is essentially the archetype on which all other first person shooters are built. You go through various levels, killing zombies and monsters, starting with weapons like the pistol and shotgun, and gaining new weapons like the chaingun and plasma gun.

In order to exit the level, you must find the "EXIT" and flip the switch. There might also be doors, which require keycards to open. Keycards are scattered all over, and you must find them to open the desired door(s).

There are many power-ups throughout the game, such as "Berserk," which allows you to become invincible and kill any basic enemy in one or two hits with your fists. There are also various health packs and weapon power-ups strewn across the level, sometimes in out of the way places, that are essential to your survival when you'll face off against the games bosses.

The bosses in Doom are an entirely different beast than the rest of the monsters in the game; you can't just yell "charge" and take them on at full force. Unless of course, you want to be completely and utterly annihilated. These fights are more cerebral, they require you to find a position and hunker down for a while until the monster has diverted his attention to something else (i.e. mindlessly wandering), then at that time you can proceed to blast him with your most powerful weapons. You'll find yourself repeating this process time and time again on some of the more powerful bosses throughout the game. 

Controls:

A Button - Open door, flip switch
B Button - Run (when moving)
X Button - Change weapon
Y Button - Shoot
L Button - Strafe left
R Button - Strafe right
Start Button - Pause/Unpause
Select Button - View Automap

Hints:

Random Weapons Bug
Immediately after picking up a chainsaw, switch to a weapon that you have no ammo for and try to fire it. When the empty weapon is used it will turn into another random weapon, which may be one you haven't found yet. As they say in the industry, this is a bug, not a feature, so it doesn't always work the same way.

This is one of those block-a-riffic puzzle games, where giant blocks fall from the sky, and you have to prevent them from stacking up too high, while dueling an opponent. Why? Because stacking them too high causes the sky to fall, or something catastrophic like thatleaving you vulnerable to your opponent's attack. So what do you do? You match up three or more like-colored blocks. This causes them to disappear in a magical flash. But not only that, but depending on which blocks you vanquish, it unleashes an attack on your opponent. You win when you kill your opponent, or when your opponent's blocks stack up too high. Yeah. I know. It's Columns with a twist.

Anyway, I suck at these block-a-riffic puzzle games, so I lost alot. But you know what? It's still helluva fun. Check it out.

With the defection of Jimmy Lee, the Shadow Master must recruit a new Second in Command...

Jimmy: Good to be back on the Light Side, Bro! Let's Clean-Up this town!

--from the Sega Genesis Double Dragon 5: The Shadow Falls instruction manual

Double Dragon 5 is very different from its predecessors. This is the first Double Dragon that wasn't a side scroller. This game was actually a fighter. It's a lot like Street Fighter, or Mortal Kombat. There are three modes of gameplay, tournament, versus, and quest mode. In tournament mode, you will fight people at random, it's a good way to prepare for quest mode. In versus mode, you will need a friend to beat up. In quest mode, it will tell you a sort of cheesy story as to why you have to fight all these people. It's not a bad game except for the fact it's been done a million times, but I guess it's a decent change from the same old Double Dragon story. If you are a fan of fighting games or a fan of Double Dragon, this game is for you.

Fight your way through tournament mode, or battle head to head with a friend.

Anyways, this is basically the story behind the Dragon Ball saga. Actually, it's the complete DB saga except for the last part, which is covered in the next Gokuden game (which also covers the DBZ saga). It just tells a story, so it's pretty linear, and it's got a lot of text, and it's actually, you know, kinda fun. Since stuff actually happens in this game, and not just guys circling each other and going uwaaaaaaaaaaaaa the whole time. Okay, so it's pretty obvious I didn't play it very far, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

Translation Description:

This translation has had some very impressive hacking work done to it (including a variable-width font by F.H.), but it's still kinda hard to follow. The script sounds like it hasn't been edited or changed from the original Japanese at all, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of available space, because there's an entire page at the Kakkoii site with abbreviations in the translation and what they mean. Not their fault though, I mean if there's no space there's no space. Still, like when you rescue all the women in the beginning? What the hell was going on there? This project is on temporary hold until a translator is found. If you can help, let M'Rhan know.

Yup, yet another DBZ fighting game on the Super NES; this makes it the fourth. So what makes this particular flavor different? Mostly, just slightly prettier graphics thanks to the SA-1 chip. DBZ fans will most likely enjoy the game; while others will simply see a sluggish fighter with pretty graphics. Shrug.

Translation Description:

This ROM patch is 95% complete. Only the life bars and V S. mode are not done. All other text and menus are translated. The only real issues with this patch are the fact that the replacement font is too big compared to the original Japanese font. This is very apparent when playing through story mode. However, there is a very small amount of text, so it does not really matter. This translation is very playable and understandable. (If you have ever seen DBZ)

This game is pretty much the same as all the DBZ games on the NES, in that you fly around and use cards to fight. One noticeable difference is the fact that you no longer use cards to move (thank GOD). I'm pretty sure that the events in this game are the same as those in the first two NES games (hell, maybe even all three), so why bother playing those when you can play this? Laaaaa!

Translation Description:

Everything is translated up to the battle with Captain Ginew. Don't ask me how far in the game that is, though. Seeing as how the patch is at 96% though, I would wager that it's pretty damned far.

Tips:

Saiyan Level-Up
When Goku, Vegeta, or Gohan reaches a health level below 5, use a card like Korin, Kami, or Shenron, that fully heals a character, on them, and they will grow one level. This can be recognized in the show when Vegeta tells Krillin to hurt him badly and then let Dende heal him so he can become stronger.

Super Saiyajin Battle
When you are fighting Freeza in his fourth and final form, let a weak character like Kuririn or Chao-Zu. My preferred choice will be Chao-Zu. Do not let Son Goku, Vegita, Gohan and Piccolo die.  After defeating Freeza in his final scene, the usual credits, showing Goku flying will be seen until Vegita appears. Vegita will then transform to Super
Saiyjin Vegita and so will Goku transform to Super Saiyajin Goku. Thus, the ultimate battle among the super saiyajin begins.  Super Saiyajin Vegita is by far the toughest boss in the entire game, even stronger than the final form of
Freeza. Once you defeat Super Saiyjin Vegita, you get a new ending that is different from the normal.

At the intro screen, when you hear Goku talking, hold the L and R button and rotate the D-pad and the four buttons [A, B, X, Y] in a circular manner.  Repeat this until you hear a chime and Goku's voice again.

Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden II

The second in the fabled Super Butouden Trilogy. Gideon Zhi says that this one is the best, but I'm not sure why. All the opponents keep running circles around you and beating the holy hell out of you quick as lightning, and summoning these gigantic energy bolts of death, and you're lucky if you can figure out how to jump. And forget blocking a goddamn thing. Maybe it's because I don't know how to play, but from what I've seen, I certainly don't want to bother learning.

All the Butouden games were also released in France, for some bizarre reason. Hey man, don't ask me.

Translation Description:

A lot of this is done, well actually just the story and stuff like that. Opening menus and battles menus aren't done, nor is the title screen, and on and on. What IS done is so incoherent that you may as well have just stuck with the French text and busted out your dictionary. In short, SNK would be proud.

This patch is to be used with the French version of this game, not the Japanese one. Okay?

Tips:

Extra Characters
At the intro screen, when you see someone flying but you only see his hand, press Up, X, Down, B, L, Y, R, A.

Tiny Fighter
On the screen where the fighters are talking before the fight, press up or down 10 times

Turbo Mode
At the black screen before the title screen, hold L + R+Start + select on controller 2 until Goku speaks

I have to say that this Super Butouden game is the lesser of all three. The game sucks anyways; it's slow, that damned split-screen thing bugs the hell out of me, and forget about such trivial things as combos. I mean, all the Butoudens are like that. But to take away the Story Mode?! What the hell reason do you have to play this game?

Translation Description:

Everything's done except the menus. Whether you choose this patch or AGTP's is simply a matter of eeny-meeny-miney-moe, as they're pretty much the same in every respect. There's patches in this ZIP file for both the Japanese and French versions of the game.

Tips:

Extra Character
At the intro screen, immediately after you hear a voice talking, press Up, X, Down, B, L, Y, R,

Turbo mode
Hold A + B+X + Y+L + R on controller two and power on the SNES system. Release the button after Goku's Kamekameha.

Power Ups
Before a fight, while the characters talk to each other, enter these codes to power-up your character and
strengthen your attacks. If done correctly, your character should charge up.
1: Up, L, Down, Y 
2: Left, R, L, Right

Yup, it's Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II with some improved graphics and sound. That's all, really. If it's anything like the (already in english) Gameboy Color game, DW2 has been tweaked a little to not make it so unbearably slow and boring late into the game. Still, Dragon Warrior is cool, and don't forget it.

Translation Description:

There's two patches for this game: the DW patch (version 2.0) has names that are in keeping with the NES DW games, like Brecconary and Gwaelin and stuff. The DQ patch (version 2.0) has the translated Japanese names, like Roto, and some others I can't think of. This is an extremely high-quality translation, though not without its faults, and if Enix America actually gave a damn about its fans I'd say don't play this and buy the Gameboy Color game, but for now I say leech away! Enjoy the fruits of Yuji Horii's love for free, and be satisfied.

Version 2.0 includes tons of bugfixes and assembly-level improvements, like speed increases on copiers and stuff. Good work, this.

Tips:

Rename the Prince and Princess
To rename the Prince (2nd character) to whatever you want, start the game up, then choose to Continue an
Adventure. When you are at the 'file screen', put the cursor to the left of the file you want to change the name.
Hold the directional pad to the Left and also hold the Start button and push the A button with them still held down.  A naming prompt will then appear for you to enter in the new name.

To change the name of the Princess (3rd character), put the cursor to the left of the file you want to change her name in, and this time hold Right on the directional pad along with the Start button, and then press the A button while still holding right + Start. A naming prompt will then appear for her.  You must have the Prince in the party for the code to change his name work, and the same for the Princess.

Aaaahh, Dragon Quest III. What self-respecting Dragon Quest fan and RPG lover could ever dislike that game? This SNES remake not only ups the graphic and musical quality to better-than-DQVI levels, but all the monster attacks are animated, which looks super sweet! Small Medals were also added, as well as various Pachisi tracks scattered across the globe, and a bonus dungeon that you can access when you beat the game.

All that's fine and good, but I still prefer my Gameboy Color remake of DQIII. You get all that new stuff (except the graphic/musical enhancements.. but since when was DQ about pretty pictures?), plus you can collect Monster Medals which can get you into another bonus dungeon! Pretty tasty!

Translation Description:

Dragon Quest III Reprise, one of the most remarkable Dragon Quests made for the SFC/SNES, is finally being translated. AND NO! This translation is not going to be abandoned. Currently it is in a TESTING PHASE!!! Which means all of the work is done, it's just being revised and fixed! This is as of September 20, 2008.

If you like the old-school RPG "flava," than you will love Dragon Quest V. This is the first Dragon Quest game to appear on the Super Famicom, so it isn't that innovative compared to the NES installments. The graphics are barely a step up from Dragon Quest IV, and the basic game engine is still the same (not that it has undergone much change at all to this day, besides the addition of a Job system in DQVI and DQVII).

The story revolves around the son of Papas, who is either a King or a wandering mercenary. That's for you to figure out. Of course, you play as Papas' son. The beginning part of the game focus on your (mis) adventures as you follow Papas around while he carries out various jobs, at the tender age of six. This abruptly ends when tragedy strikes and you end up in bondage (no, not THAT kind of bondage). You eventually escape via a plot device stolen entirely from J.R.R. Tolkien, and arrive back at your hometown some ten years later, only to find that the region has been more or less turned upside-down in your absence. You of course have to set things right, and this of course sends on a much larger quest, eventually following the footsteps of your father.

One of the interesting things in Dragon Quest V's game play that makes it slightly more than a beefed-up Dragon Quest IV is the ability to capture monsters after battle. Now, monster capturing does appear in all of the later Dragon Quest games, but it plays a much larger role in this installment, since for most of the game at least one of your two companions in battle will be a monster you captured. It adds a little depth to your battle strategy because anywhere that your carriage is accessible, you can hot-swap monsters in and out of the fight. This becomes necessary because monsters all have strengths and weaknesses that can either help or hinder you. And you have to choose wisely whom you take into dungeons and towers since you can't usually hot-swap once you're inside. You're stuck with whom you take, so choose wisely.

All in all, this is a very enjoyable game. As of this writing, there are two translations available for the game, and both are well done and will see you through to the end.

Translation Description:

This is well done and very polished translation. It took three years to complete, and although much of that three years was chalked up while waiting for a small bug to be ironed out, the folks involved didn't sit idly by. The script was poured over and edited a great deal, resulting in a very loose translation with a lot of character. While it's not entirely a literal translation, the edits didn't go the extremes that Working Designs sometimes goes to. Some people will like the looseness, some will not. The choice is yours.

A minor fix patch should be out soon, that fixes names and such.

Tips:

Easter Egg
Put the following items, and NO others, in the main character's inventory IN order. Don't equip any of them.

Cypress Stick
Sharpened Bone
Hat of Happiness
Club
Saw Blade
Cloak of Evasion

The most noticeable effect of this is all normal attacks will be terrific blows. And all monsters who CAN join you WILL join you. There may be some other effects but I haven't noticed them.

Ok, let's go back in time a bit?say 10 years or so? The Year is 1995, towards the twilight of the 16-bit era. You are Enix, creator of the record-selling,ground breaking RPG series Dragon Quest. Now, it's been 3 years since the series last outing, the incredible Dragon Quest 5. Obviously, Enix was presented with a challenge. How can you improve upon a game like Dragon Quest 5? A game that had such things as a multi-generation storyline, monsters joining your battle party, numerous mini-games and other distractions. The answer? Take most of what was good about it, and expand upon it even more. With the exception of the multi-generation aspect, everything you loved about Dragon Quest 5 has returned here intact, and in some cases?improved. A welcome addition is the return of the class system, last seen in Dragon Quest 3. However, unlike Dragon Quest 3, you can now freely switch your characters between classes, and work them up to new advanced level jobs.

Each class, as you'd expect has special abilities and spells, to make each one useful in a different way. Now, besides that?the game brings several other firsts. For one, the game features not 1 ,not 2, not 3, but 4 different worlds to explore. Also , it's the first game in the series to feature monster animation, and better than average graphics.

Story:

A pretty good story, but not quite as good as DQ5's. The game begins in a rather strange fashion. With you, and your fellow party members being massacred by Uglypeople.com Spokesmodel, and all around not-nice guy, Mudo. As you can probably guess, this is not a good thing. But just when you think the games over before it even begins, you wake up! The whole ordeal was just a dream. But still, it leaves you with many questions. Who were those other people who were fighting with you? And more importantly? who was that big tough-guy who kicked the crap out of your dreaming arse?! So you set out on a quest to find answers to those questions, and many more. Overall, it's an interesting and engrossing storyline. Of course, since it's a Dragon Quest?don't expect much in the way of character development. But the main over-arching story will keep you guessing what will happen next.Very good, but still room for improvement in some places.

Gameplay:

Classic Dragon Quest here all the way! The menu's are as simple and easy to use as ever. No real changes from the previous games here. Anyone with even the slighest experience with previous games in the series will have no trouble getting used to the controls. Of course, there were some changes here and there?but nothing major enough to make you have to re-learn everything. The biggest difference in gameplay is in the re-introduction of the newly expanded class system. Unlike before however? there are now advanced classes, as well as more variety in the basic ones.

Challenge/Difficulty:

The game starts out easy enough, but eventually things gets more and more challenging. Although this may not be THE HARDEST RPG you'll ever play, it can rank up there pretty high. My best tips are the obvious. Keep leveling up, and buy all the latest equipment. Besides that, save often. And even then, you shouldn't be playing this game expecting a walk in the park. This is old-school difficulty that will leave the youngsters raised on the modern fluff running home to mommy and daddy.

Graphics:

The first Dragon Quest that put effort into trying impress us visually. Not only are the overall graphics of a much higher quality than DQ5's, but the game takes a chapter out of Sega's Phantasy Star series by implementing monster animations! Something every Dragon Quest game since, original or remix has had. Overall, this is a pretty game.

Sound:

As usual, Sugiyama never fails to impress. In fact, this may be one of his best works ever. A great emotional, and moodsetting soundtrack. You gotta hear the Orchestrated Soundtrack CD as well. Not a bad song in this game!

Replay Value:

You'll play it and replay it. There's plenty of little extras here and there to keep you coming back. Bonus-Dungeon upon beating the game, loads of mini-games and things to collect. What more could you want?!

Overall:

Ok, so you must all think i'm biased for giving every Dragon Quest a VERY favorable review. While that's true, I try and give every game what I think it's deserving of. Dragon Quest 6 has so much to offer, missing out should be a crime. Play this game already!

Translation Description:

You may have seen NoPrgress mentioned on DeJap and stuff, but don't be fooled! This patch right here is entirely his own work. And it looks sweeeeeet! You can play the game from beginning to end; the untranslated 10% is just random strings here and there that have no real bearing on the game. There are some fatal bugs in the game (most notably, backing out of the Info->All option sometimes crashes the game), so if you plan to use this translation (and you should, since it's currently the furthest along), be sure to keep a batch of savestates at the ready.

NoPrgress has stopped working on this translation, and DeJap is taking over the project.

Tips:

Bonus Dungeon.
Complete the game and start a new one. Now go to the torch room in Darma Shinden after having leveled up all 18 classes to at least level 6 to unlock the bonus dungeon.

From the Castle Mordroc's deep vault a ghastly stench searched through the cold, damp midnight air: an obvious proof that the wizard's favorite, the flamethrowing dragon Singe, was home. Singe is the beast that guards Princess Daphne who's locked up in the dungeons deep below the ground level.

Dirk the Brave went right to the castle gate. He felt no fear, but fear is only for the weak. No-one else than him would even dare come close to the frightful castle where Mordroc keeps the helpless princess. Now it's time for heroes, now it's time for old honourable action. Now it's time to seek out the Dragon's Lair...

--From the SNES Dragon's Lair instruction manual.

Overview:

OH NO!!! The evil dragon, Singe, has kidnapped the beautiful princess Daphne (Wow, there are a lot of games with this sort of story) and now Dirk the Daring must run and save her. Grab your sword and explore all 24 levels of the Dragon's tower until you are face to face with Singe (and what an ugly face it is). Good Luck, Dirk (you're gonna need it).

Dragon's Lair for the SNES is unlike the arcade or the NES version in the way that Konami changed it from a side scrolling adventure to an action platformer much like Castlevania. The graphics for this game are much improved from the NES version, right down to a shine going down the sword as you swing. The music is much the same, however they changed it to a more diverse melody from the 8-bit NES and Arcade version. This game is fun and addictive, so get to playing, and good luck!

Directions:

Dragons Lair is action/platform full of monsters such as dark knights, little dragons, bats, and animated brooms. There are no bosses in this game other than the dragon, Singe. Armed with a sword and weapons you pick up along the way to throw, such as axes, knives, and shurikens, fight your way through all 24 levels of the keep. Start out on the ramparts and make your way into the bowels of the keep to save the beautiful princess Daphne. Play as 1 player fighting alone through the game, or get help from a friend as 2 players where you take turns being Dirk. Be sure to keep an eye on the number of shields in the lower left hand corner, because those are your life. When you run out, you're dead, and you only get three lives. Don't worry though, you can pick up more shields along your way by hitting the little balls placed around each level. So hop on your computer and have some fun!

Players control Lee, and must defeat the sailor from the dance in Hong Kong, the chefs from the Chinese Restaurant in San Francisco, the martial arts master who challenges Lee, amongst others to progress through the game, recalling major action scenes from the film. However, the video game leaves out valuable plot information from the film and most of the romantic content between Bruce Lee and his future wife.

Players can use a variety of martial arts moves to defeat their enemies and build up a chi meter, which can help unleash special moves on their opponents. The game is noted for its difficulty and it takes an expert player to complete or even advance to the later stages. The player has three continues, and if lost, they must fight The Phantom (the personification of Bruce's fear who takes the form of an armored Asian warrior) to continue, though he is near invincible. They face The Phantom again at the end as a final boss.

The game supports up to three players simultaneously, playing through the game co-operatively, or against each other in a battle mode. Oddly, the additional players only control clones of Lee, albeit with slightly different colored trousers.

Tips:

Unlimited Chi
Enter options screen, set the sound to 'Monaural' ,press Select, A, L, A, R, Y

Level Select
Go to the options screen. Then go to 'Music Test'. When your reach the screen immediately press B, A, R.

The universe as we, the Drakkonian people know it, is threatened by the four dragon kings who control the forces of nature; Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. These dragons have stolen the Drakkhen's eight tears; gems that represent all the forces of magic. Each dragon has one son and one daughter for a total of four princes and four princesses. Each prince and princess was bequeathed one of the eight tears.

Your quest is to recover the eight gems. Having done so, the control of the dragons will be broken and control of the universe will be restored to the benevolent and magical Drakkhen.

Your task is complicated by the existence of two distinctly different political parties of the princes and princesses. The League of the Ninth Tear is sympathetic to the Drakkonian cause and its members will assist you in your quest. The Alliance of Fire, however, would like to see the evil reign of the dragons continue. As a result, you may need to slay some of the princes and princesses to complete your quest.

But you must be careful not to attack too hastily! The success of your adventure depends upon the cooperation of those princes and princesses who sympathize with your cause. Sympathetic princes and princesses are of little help if they are dead!

You must approach your quest in a step-by-step manner. It is important that you complete the tasks in the order you are told. The renegade warrior is doomed to failure.

You must exercise great caution! Many of the inhabitants are very strong and do not appreciate your intervention. Beware of entering castles unprepared. Heed the hints that point the way to your destiny.

During your quest, you will encounter inns, shrines, and other ordinary places. You may enter these at any time and they can be valuable sources of information and supplies.

Dragon View (also known as Drakkhen II or Super Drakkhen) is a video game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1994. Although it bears little resemblance to its predecessor, Drakkhen, it utilizes the same pseudo-3D overworld system that the series is most famous for. Other features of Dragon View are its side-view Action RPG hybrid gameplay (used when exploring more detailed areas such as towns and dungeons), its well translated first person storyline, and its emphasis on player-driven "free" exploration.

Gameplay:

Most of the gameplay in Dragon View takes place through a side-view Action RPG hybrid system. Action occurs on a widescreen display, with a large panel displaying character and enemy information taking up the lower part of the screen. A decorative bar at the top of the screen provides a buffer and helps to present the game in a cinematic light.

Gameplay in this mode is reminiscent of Zelda II for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The character navigates various areas, exploring and fighting monsters in the traditional sense; an x plane (left and right motion) and y plane (jumping) control system. Movement through depth via z coordinates is also an important part of gameplay as it useful for evasion. While side-scrolling Action games in the past have used similar systems of movement (such as Final Fight), Dragon View is unique amongst them for blending this style in a medieval setting and with RPG elements.

Dragon View does not limit the player to moving in any one direction through the game; the player is allowed (and is sometimes required) to backtrack through any area or dungeon, all the way back to the game's starting point. It is this structure that often teases players with upgrades to equipment and special items that they cannot reach until later in the game, after they have unlocked certain capabilities, at which point they may return and claim the upgrade at their leisure.

Also present are the more traditional RPG growth elements. The character grows numerically stronger by gaining levels, as preset amounts of experience points are reached. The reward for a level gain is an increase in the offensive and defensive character stats, allowing the player to safely survive in more dangerous areas. Other stats, such as HP and MP are increased when the player finds special items, often hidden inside areas of dungeons or the world map.

3D Overworld:

The Drakkhen series' most recognizable feature is its custom overworld engine. First used by the original Amiga version of Drakkhen, it was later used in the PC and SNES ports. The Dragon View version sports basic terrain shading and mountainlike "boundaries" that enclose areas of the continent. The day/night cycle however is no longer present.

While not "True 3D", the overworld engine simulates depth on its own (without the aid of supplementary hardware such as the Super FX chip) using sprite scaling and rudimentary rendering. This system is able to run smoothly on standard SNES hardware because little more than half of the total screen area is ever in use. Since the top and bottom panels are completely static during overworld navigation, all hardware power is focused on rendering the first person view. Even so, framerates can suffer as many sprites are sometimes present on a single screen.

This is one of the weirdest Super Famicom games I've ever had the chance of playing. And it's also pretty damn fun. There's not much of a story to start with, but it's enough to get you started.

You play a generic hero (who's a kid) destined to dream the same thing over and over until you rescue the world of Enderia, which is governed by the evil demon Akumu. But the hero isn't alone. Along the way, he'll find companions which will hopefully help him out.

The game is different from most console RPGs in two ways: First, you can find different "kigurumis", or costumes, when you beat your enemies - and when you wear it, your abilities will change for the better or worse. This is rather interesting because of the amount of enemies that there are in the game; you begin with a sparrow costume (which the hero does not like), but eventually you find other costumes which you can change in special dressing rooms spread across the mazes. Oh yeah, there's also tailor shops where you can modify, store or take out your suits, since you can only carry six at a time. And each suit may have a special ability as well.

The other curious thing is the battle system. You basically have a typical turn-by-turn mode, but you attack using punches or kicks along a grid that surrounds your enemies. You can choose exactly where to hit them; this may prove to be useful to find weak spots. Also, certain enemies are weak to punches or kicks. The game will tell you if you did something right, which helps.

The music is? well? it's catchy. There's some areas in the game that sound totally trippy, like something out of a Mexican late-1960's movie. Ever seen any of those badly dubbed lucha libre movies on MST3K or public access channels? Well, something like that. But even trippier.

Translation Description:

Well, the translation is finished, but it still has a few bugs. The hacking in this game is amazing, just as the rest of KingMike's works. And check out that pretty dialogue font!

Now Jimmy and Charlie must fight for their lives through four Dream Worlds (Medieval, Egyptian, Prehistoric, and Future) if they hope to return home safely. Collecting nine hidden puzzle pieces from each level will take the guys to the final showdown with the Critic and hopefully back to reality.

Negative Reception:

The graphics look like they come out of an early Atari 7800 video game. Due to the general blockiness of the graphics, a knight looks very similar to a golem in this game. Only one song is used throughout the entire video game; this was extremely amateurish for 1993 standards.

Dual Orb 2 is a fairly generic RPG for the SNES. The graphics are good, the plot's alright, the music's good (although the inclusion of a boss battle theme would have been nice?), and the whole thing screams of "basically above average."

You play as Aleth, heir-successor-person who was mysteriously found on a mountainside. You grow up being trained as a priest next to the crown prince Lagnus, and all is hunky-dory. You even go out and build a fort in the woods when you're a kid. Then, at one point, a visiting bard (who happens to be the only bard in any RPG I've played who can really kick some ass in battle) needs to get to the neighboring country, so you and Lagnus tail along. You naturally do your damnedest to get in trouble and break a seal and wake up your third real party member, and when you get back home, the place has been ransacked by the stereotypical Evil Invading Empire, and stuff happens and things. Yep. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but it works.

The interesting thing about the game is that there are very few real weapons that you can buy, maybe only ten or fifteen varieties total. Rather, you can spend your money upgrading your weaponry. Each time you upgrade it, it gets stronger (naturally) and once you upgrade it past a certain point, it becomes an uberweapon and you can use a special sekrit technique if you're low on health.

You wander around in dungeons and on the overworld, like in standard RPGs, and this is where one of my minor gripes comes in. The overworld is done in a tilted Mode-7 style, like FF3/6's overworld, but quite simply, it's too zoomed-in. The world is kind of small, but when you're trying to explore the massive southern continent with the desert on it, the zoomed-in view, combined with the encounter rate, actually started to get me kinda lost.

Speaking of the encounter rate, I might as well mention right here and now that it's high. Very high. Some might consider it to be ridiculously high. Battles go by quickly so it wasn't much of a big deal for me, but it might be for some people. Another thing I should probably mention in this paragraph, while I'm dealing with the combat system, is the difficult level. Some people consider this to be one of the hardest SNES RPGs ever, but I can't say I had a very difficult time of it? The fact of the matter is that stat-boosting spells and items are cumulative and last for the duration of the battle (or your character's health bar) so you can just pump your party up until the enemies aren't doing squat for damage against you and then just slaughter them.

The high encounter rate and general above-average difficulty of the normal random battles was nice, though. I found myself actually having to level up. Not for extremely excessive amounts of time - the game is only 20 or 30 someodd hours long - but it was definitely necessary. The prospect of a bit of a challenge was fun for a change.

I freely admit to not having beaten many fan-translated games (aside from the ones I've worked on, heh?) I can probably count them all on one hand. Suffice to say, I beat Dual Orb 2, and I was very satisfied with it. Your mileage may vary.

Translation Description:

6 years after the original release, Nightcrawler continues to improve the Dual Orb 2 translation. The newest version (1.5) introduces a host of fixes and minor improvements. This translation is looking better than ever though two somewhat obscure minor issues remain (check readme file for details), though most players will probably never notice.

While previous games such as Alternate Reality: The Dungeon, The Bard's Tale, Ultima and Wizardry offered Dungeons & Dragons-style role playing, Dungeon Master established several new standards for role playing and computer games in general. Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view. Abstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol.

This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.

Another factor in its popularity may have been the imaginative mythology, with players often reporting a nurturing identity with their chosen characters. Nancy Holder, wife of producer Wayne Holder, wrote the storyline in the manual (from a base scenario suggested by Michael Newton and the FTL team). She is a successful novelist, having written for series including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Smallville.

Many reviewers considered Dungeon Master as the best example of its genre, despite the many clones that arrived to challenge it. First of these was Bloodwych (1989), featuring similar game play but adding a mode allowing two simultaneous players on one machine. Other notable clones included Captive and Eye of the Beholder. While Dungeon Master itself was inspired by early Ultima games, it was also itself the source of inspiration for the later Ultima Underworld game. Game journalist Niko Nirvi wrote that no 3D role playing title before Ultima Underworld (1992) could challenge Dungeon Master as a game.

To date Dungeon Master retains a small but faithful following online, with several fan ports and remakes available or in development.

You must survive the trials and enemies from each of the five different ages. Defeat various creatures to evolve. It is you who decides how your creature evolves and whether you will make it to "Eden" and win the game.

--From the SNES EVO: Search For Eden instruction manual.

Overview:

Charles Darwin, eat your heart out! I mean really, you start out as fish, and you evolve over the ages into an intelligent life form. Now try to tell me that he didn't have something to do with this game. Gaia, the third child of Sol, has created life, and the one who evolves the most and achieves intelligence can enter Eden and be her husband (being that she created the life and now she's going to wed one...... she's marrying her own offspring.... yuck!) As you evolve and venture through the world, you encounter strangely evolved creatures that seem unnatural. It's up to you to figure out who is behind it all and defeat these creatures before they throw off the balance of the world. Good Luck, lifeform!

EVO: Search for Eden is a very addicting game that has wonderful graphics (which are much like a cross between Super Mario World and the Sega game Ecco the Dolphin). The music of this game fits with the different stages of the game. All in all, this game is definitely worth playing.

Directions:

Evo is a side scrolling action game that has an interface a lot like Super Mario World, with the gameplay on a side-scrolling platform and the stage selection in an overhead view of the level. Swim, crawl, walk, and fly through five levels consisting of the Age of Fish, the Age of Amphibians, the Age of Dinosaurs, the Age of Mammals, and finally the Age of Eden.

In the beginning, the only attack you have is a bite. As you evolve you gain new attacks such as kick and jump on your enemies. Use the menu to view your stats, record your evolution, and evolve. You evolve by collecting EVO Points from eating the remains of dead enemies, the more powerful the enemy, the more points you get. Your EVO Points are displayed on the upper right hand part of the screen. The better the evolution, the more points it costs. Along the way you can eat plants and defenseless creatures to replenish your health, which is displayed on the upper left hand part of the screen. You can evolve your body to gain more hit points, as well as various other evolutions to improve your ability to attack and defend yourself.

Throughout the levels you will come across four different crystals. The yellow gives you tips on evolution and gameplay, red temporarily changes your body into better creature for a short period of time, green will revert you back to a lesser life form when the terrain and environment calls for it, and blue gives you an extreme boost in EVO points. At the end of each level is a strangely evolved creature that must be beaten, such as the Ultimate Shark, the Bee Queen, and Belbox who claims to be the first Human. Fight your way through each level to get to the ultimate reward, to lounge in Eden with your new wife Gaia. Good Luck! 

Controls:

A Button - KICK
B Button - JUMP / SELECT ITEMS IN MENU
X Button - EAT
Y Button - ATTACK
Double-Tap D-pad - SWIM / RUN / FLY FASTER
Start Button - PAUSE
Select Button - MENU

Hints:

HP Refill
Every time you "evolve" any part of your body, your HP meter is refilled. Use this to your advantage in boss fights, just make sure you go in with plenty of spare EVO points.

Can four average kids save the world from certain destruction at the hands of an evil, alien invader? They might be inexperienced, but don't count them out!

The four spunky kids have the fate of mankind in their hands and the weight of the world on their shoulders, so it's a good thing that they have psychic powers -- and you -- on their side. As you begin this unique gaming experience and explore the world in search of the sinister spirit of Giygas, pack along our travel guide. You'll need it to find your way through Earthbound's twisted and hilarious world, and you won't want to miss a single side-trip or pass up any sights along the way. Just remember to phone dear old Mom and Dad -- after all, the kids will wander a long way from home.

--from the SNES EarthBound Manual

A game where you can name ALL of your characters and your magic and you don't have to stick with the pathetic excuses for names. That is one of the things I like in an RPG, the ability to personalize the game. It really opens the way for your imagination. Earthbound was probably one of the best RPG's on the SNES. It had pretty good graphics and the sound was awesome. Where this game really shines is in gameplay, it's easy to pick up and lots of fun. Try Earthbound as soon as possible. 

Directions:

Just like any RPG game, walk around until you come around a bunch of enemies and you have to kill them! Later on in the game, you get to lead a full party of other people with great strengths! Gain and save money to buy items, such as weapons.

L Button - Check whatever's around you
R Button - Ring bicycle bell while riding bike

Select Button - View HP/PP/cash windows

Hints:

Level 99 Battle (PAR Code)
C1D9FBFF 

Tips:

secret scene
Talk to Paulas father in Twoson, then visit the hotel.  When you leave the hotel a bonus scene involving Paulas father will be shown.

Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past
Note: This only works in the Super Famicom version of Earthbound(Mother 2).  In Mother 2, you could use the Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past, which was never intended obviously, since the feature is missing in Earthbound.

Infinite use of Rock Candy
You can use the Rock Candy in battles an unlimited amount of times to increase your stats. You have to have it in one of the two very bottom spaces of one of your characters' inventories, and you have to use it with any condiment (preferably something like Sugar Packets or Jars of Delisauce, because they will increase one of your stats by 2 instead of one). This will allow you to get greater boosts in stats when you level up.

$50 Easy in Twoson
Outside of the hotel room in Twoson, there will be a man sitting at a table. Constantly speak to him (his response will change each time) until he decides to hand you $50 so you can leave him alone. It takes about 20 sessions of talking for him to fork it over, but it's well worth it, plus it'll make up for the night you spent at the hotel.

Avoid battles.
If you go into a room with a large amount or any amount of enemies in it, you can exit the room and re-enter it
and the amount of enemies changes sometimes even taking them all out of that room. This can eliminate time consuming fights.

It's a day like any other. A crow is chasing a worm, a worm named Jim. Today the worm escapes to safety and the crow eats dirt.

Meanwhile, in outer space... Psy-Crow is chasing a small renegade ship. The ship's pilot has stolen an ultra high tech indestructible super space cyber suit. Psy-Crow overtakes the renegade ship and they face off head to head. Psy-Crow pulls his gun. The renegade pulls out an even bigger gun. Wrought with gun envy, Psy-Crow pulls out a huge monster gun. The renegade, realizing he has been outmatched, pleads for mercy. But Psy-Crow, under direct orders from the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug for a Butt, blasts the renegade and his entire ship to smithereens.

The suit falls gently to a strange planet below.

The strange planet is our planet.

PLANET EARTH

Back on earth, our slimy hero is wondering if it's safe and if he has eluded the crow. Jim looks left, then right. It seems he has given the crow the slip. Jim returns to his normal daily life, cruising about, avoiding crows and doing other general worm-like things.

Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place. Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit, and we witness the birth of Earthworm Jim. Jim checks out the suit and he notices a red thingie attached to his side, which just happens to be a plasma blaster. He pulls it out of the holster and starts playing with the buttons. Meanwhile, off in the distance, the crow is still looking for his lunch. Jim finds the trigger and lets loose with a plasma blast. BLAMO! The crow is torched! Taking a moment to gather his thoughts, Jim leans up against a tree. Due to the suit's incredible power, Jim forces the tree over, right on top of the now barely conscious crow. His lifetime nemesis is never to be seen again.

Our hero thinks he's got it pretty easy now, but...
he hears something in the distance. Psy-Crow, the intergalactic bounty hunter is standing over a burn in the grass which the suit had left behind. Peering over the toppled tree, Jim sees Psy-Crow talking to the Queen, informing her that the suit is very near. The Queen knows that the suit will make her even more beautiful than her imprisoned twin sister, "Princess-What's-Her-Name." Jim decides he needs to meet this Princess and dashes off to find her before Psy-Crow can find him and the suit...

--From the SNES Earthworm Jim instruction manual.

Overview:

Earthworm Jim is a very amusing game. The graphics and sounds were great, along with a huge amount of comic relief. There were a whole bunch of funny things he would say that were just hilarious. This was also one of the first games I played that featured the very cartoon looking graphics.

Earthworm Jim was a very popular game for a while. It even spawned a TV show and a comic book. They didn't run very long, but did okay for a while. Earthworm Jim is a fun game, and if you haven't tried it, I suggest you give it a go right now.

Now, run into the thorns until Jims health reaches from 20% to 30%. Now when you get hit this time- the second you get hit, run to the exit where you get warped to the next stage and Jim won't be dead yet. You'll appear in the next stage, now quickly run as soon as the stage begins, and it looks like Jim has a heart attack or something because he dies for no reason- this is most likely because the game couldn't calculate the damage taken by the thorns fast enough to make Jim die
in the previous stage.

Whassup w/ Jim?

Once upon a time, there was a worm who was victorious in defeating the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt. Her lovely twin sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (our heroine) was crushed by an errant flying cow (launched by the unknowing Jim) and fell into a slime pool below where she was innocently standing. After removing said cow from atop said princess, Jim quickly re-inflated the squashed lady.

Jim bared his enamored worm-hearts to the princess. The Texan worm did not resemble the prince her mother had told her stories about in any way, shape, or form. Therefore, she refused his love. After all, who ever heard of a princess falling in love with a worm? Frog, maybe... but not a worm.

Jim quickly composed love songs, showed off his physical prowess by lifting stuff that was so heavy he had to grunt, and drove his pocket rocket as fast as he could with the stereo turned way up. Jim did everything he could to woo her. Thoroughly impressed by his really way cool 'Annelid w/ Attitude' bumper sticker, personal grooming habits, and Tiny Elvis collection (not to mention his hefty bank account), she decided that she should be in love with him after all.

Suddenly, from out of nowhere (actually, from just behind a big rock really, really close to them), Psy-Crow swooped down with his jet pack and kidnapped the lovely aristocrat. As the only heir to the throne, her husband would become Monarch of the Galaxy! Ruler of the Universe! Master of All! King of Burgers! Eligible for deep discounts at "Czarware - Clothing for Monarchs" fashion emporiums! And Psy-Crow wants that crown for his own diminutive head.

Jim has to stop them before they reach the Lost Vegas system where they can get a quick, non-consenting wedding 24 hours a day. Jim blasts off on their trail, following them from planet to planet. Many of these worlds are the summer homes of his worst enemies like Evil the Cat (let's face it, Heck gets just too darn hot in August, even for Evil). Jim's not going alone this time. He's enlisted his pal Snott to help him chase down Psy-Crow and nab the woman of his dreams.

--From the SNES Earthworm Jim 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

When asked "What are you? A man or a worm?" Jim replied "I'm a worm and proud of it." Then he blew the other guy's face off. I mean really, what can you say about a worm with a gun, and let me tell you this guy means business. He is armed with everything including a snott swing, now how many of you can say you have one of those?

In Earthworm Jim 2, run around the different levels trying to get your girlfriend, Princess Whats-Her-Name, back from the Evil Psy-Crow (wait, isn't that the objective of the first one? Jeez, can't she keep from getting kidnapped?).

The exciting sequel to the famed Earthworm Jim is just that, exciting. Full of non-stop action, crazy bosses, such as a gold fish in a bowl, and an entire arsenal of weapons. The graphics of this game are awesome for the Sega Genesis, with muzzle flash from your gun, right down to the green drippings from your snott swing. The music in this game is right on the money, with captivating melodies, and it's slightly funny when matched to the scene. All in all this game is fun and keeps you wanting more.

Directions:

This game is a wonderful sequel to the original Earthworm Jim game. Graphics are well-improved, as well as more weapon choices and more interesting levels such as sub-levels to pick up extra points and more lives.

Each level is filled with interesting puzzles, most of which involve pigs, and different weapons, such as your normal gun, the bubble gun, enemy seeking missiles, and the electro-dirt gun, which helps push through soil.

Let's not forget, throughout each level there are items to be collected such as extra health and ammo. At the end of each level you'll fight a boss such as Bob the Goldfish as well as many others, or help Peter Puppy save his friends.

All of which leads up to the big fight with Psy-Crow. Defeat him before he does God-knows-what to Whats-Her-Name. Have fun!

Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
7th Saga is a SNES jRPG notorious for its unforgiving difficulty in that monsters are brutally difficult and the heroes' stats don't rise particularly generously with their levels. It is not widely known, however, that 7th Saga is the localized version of Elnard, the Japanese incarnation of this game which is much, much easier by comparison. This IPS patch restores the monster stats of Elnard to the US 7th Saga and also modifies the mechanics of player leveling such that the player will now gain stats as he or she would in Elnard, making the game's difficulty level much more reasonable. Additionally, confrontations with the rival apprentices in this game are now properly balanced, an oversight in the localized version.

"A very difficult game that needed 1 thing to be alright..."

First off, this game is VERY hard. How they expected 10 year old kids to enjoy it I will never know. Throughout this review I will point out all the good and bad points of this Super Nintendo game and once great cartoon.

Story- The basic story is that you control Eek and you have to go through 6 levels, 3 stages each, helping your friends. In the first level, a blind grandmother just starts walking and you have too keep her from danger by killing enemies and kicking her to higher platforms. The first stage is easy, the second gets harder, and the third is practically impossible. Due to the fact that this game is extremely hard. I could not get past the first level to tell you the rest of the story. (2/10)

Gameplay- The controls are simple, one button will kick grandma up so she can reach higher platforms, another will brandish Eeks weapon(a fish, O_o) for killing enemies, and the other one makes Eek jump. The controls can be very frustrating and it does not make the game fun. (3/10)

There was only 1 thing this game needed to make it decent, and that is a Level Select code. I searched all over and there aren't any on the internet. This is one of those classic games where when you die you have to start all over again. But the game is not fun, so when you die you will most likely turn the game off instead of trying again. I couldn't even get past the first level and I consider myself pretty good at video games.

Graphics- The graphics are okay. There's nothing special about them. Some things have great detail while others do not. (4/10)

Sound- The sound is also decent. I have heard worse on Super Nintendo games. All 3 stages of each level have the same music, that is something I would have changed. (3/10)

Rent or Own?- Neither. There are only 2 reasons you should even try this game. And that's if you either got it for free or are over at a friends house who has it and you just want to see how bad it is. I can't believe that I spent $12 for this game. Even though it was sealed and came with a kickass poster, it wasn't worth it.

Don't forget, this review is from a person who was a fan of the Eek the Cat show. Sadly, this game does not follow the great legacy of the show.

Okay, this is a different sort of RPG. It kinda falls into the same category as Star Ocean and Tales of Phantasia, or perhaps Radia - at least from what I can see - with a top-down, action-oriented system for fighting random battles. The graphics and cinematics are pretty, but I can't say much for the story due to my rather profound lack of Japanese knowledge, heh.

Translation Description:

This is the complete translation.

Nightcrawler has tested on real hardware to ensure it works. If you are unfamiliar with how to apply SNES patches, Nightcrawler has provided a Windows program to ensure the patch is applied correctly. For the rest of you, Nightcrawler has included a standard IPS. Also, be sure to check out the readme for some history on the translation.

The version 1.1 release fixed all reported issues to date (Nov 2008).

Emmitt Smith Football is a football game for the Super NES. Its namesake is former Cowboys all-pro running back Emmitt Smith. Like Troy Aikman NFL Football, the player can make his own plays. Most of the text in this game uses a classic video game typeface.

Possible modes of play include: exhibition mode, season mode, playoff mode, and practice mode. Smith added his voice on the game; giving positive comments on big gains and negative comments on negative plays. Most of the standard rules of the National Football League at the time of release are used (4 quarters of 15 minutes, 100 yard field, etc.). However, the options allow the player to change some of the rules used in the actual game. This game was mentioned in the November 1995 issue of Nintendo Power.

Equinox, also known as Solstice II, is an isometric 3D actionpuzzle-hybrid video game for the Super NES. It is the sequel to Solstice, a Nintendo Entertainment System game.

Plot:

Shadax, the wizard hero of Solstice, has been captured and imprisoned by his former apprentice, Sonia. It's up to his son Glendaal, the only man with the magical powers strong enough to defeat the evil sorceress, to journey through eight levels and hundreds of rooms of tricky platform-jumping and block-sliding puzzles to rescue him from the Sonia's icy fortress.

Gameplay:

Glendaal moves from room to room looking for 'tokens' (blue orbs), twelve of which must be collected and brought to a boss area where they enable the 'summoning' of one of the game's boss characters. Each of these must be defeated to enable progress to the next area. To aid the player in their quest, one projectile weapon and one magic scroll is hidden on each level for Glendaal to find. Most levels contain a number of entrances which are accessed from an over-world map, home to a sparse collection of wandering monsters.

Reception:

Equinox was awarded for having the Best Ad of 1994 by Electronic Gaming Monthly

ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game for the PC, Super NES, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and Sega [Mega-]CD. The game was licensed by MLB, but not by the Players Association, so while actual team names and logos are used, no player names are in the game.

The lead programmers for the project were James Grove and Phil King. The game's simulation engine was based on the code used for Tony La Russa Baseball, another Stormfront Studios product. The game featured video clips of Chris Berman.

ESPN National Hockey Night is a Super NES, Sega Mega Drive and PC action game where the player is cast right straight into NHL action on his TV screen. Like most ESPN games, there is an exhibition mode, a season mode, and a playoff mode.

The AI of this game is very difficult, like a hockey equivalent of Super Bases Loaded. The side view makes it more tricky and the computer opponent can sneak in goals when the player thinks that he is secure in a tied game or in a game in which he is narrowly winning. Most of the notable NHL players from the 1990s are here complete with stats to make them more realistic.

ESPN Speed World is a Super NES and Sega Genesis video game that involves the player controlling NASCAR Winston Cup stock cars as they do laps around various oval tracks, road courses, and superspeedways. All stock cars in the game have the capability to go up to 200 miles per hour (approximately 322 kilometers per hour). The object of the game is to get as close to first place as possible. This game uses Dr. Jerry Punch and an interactive pit crew to simulate the feeling of racing during the 1993 Winston Cup season. Like in most racing games, being in the top positions gives the player more points than being in the bottom positions. Stock cars can be customized with a choice of colors and styles.

Sponsors in addition to automobile manufacturers are absent due to licensing difficulties. The real-life drivers of this era are also missing because the game only has an ESPN license and not an official NASCAR license. The Sega Genesis version shows more realistic detail in the car decals and advertising billboards than the Super NES version of the game.

ESPN Sunday Night NFL is a Super NES, Sega CD, and Sega Genesis sports game that takes the fun and excitement of Sunday night NFL action and places it in a 16-bit video game console. Like in other football games, the player must run, pass, and/or kick a ball across a 100-yard field in order to score points.

But in this game, like all other ESPN-oriented video games, the game's artificial intelligence is bit tricky; sometimes wide receivers just don't want to catch the ball the way they were meant to in the playbook. The player can play in exhibition mode, season mode, or playoff mode. As well, the two ESPN announcers from the mid 1990s analyze the teams before the kickoff.

Eurit
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (USA)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Action , Multi-Directional , Strategy
Developer: Radical
Players: 2
_________________________
*
Eurit is an action game that was being developed by Radical. The game is basically a souped up version of childhood games of Tag and Capture the Flag. The game features a split-screen and is an ideal two player game. A near complete beta of this game was discovered by DreamTR, and it is probably one of the best unreleased games for the snes.

The story behind the game is that the ruler of the galaxy decides that he will retire. In order to find a suitable replacement, he sets up a tournament where wizards and warriors compete to determine who shall be ruler. Throughout the game, you travel to many worlds across the galaxy to prove your might.

There are four characters to chose from at the start of the game. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, based on their speed, spellcasting agility, and magic capacity. Through my playthrough, I used the average character.

The gameplay is very addictive, and relatively easy to get into. Basically, one of the characters starts off being "it". The person who is it cannot capture flags, so they must chase down the other character and touch them. Once you are not it, you can collect flags necessary to win the stage. 

Complicating the game is the obstacles you face. To proceed through the level, you basically have to build platforms. There are many levels with enemy creatures that usually require a number of blasts with your gun to kill. Speed tiles send you running really quickly, which can either make you quickly escape your foe, or send you far away from him.

Probably the most compelling gameplay feature for experts is the magic system. Before each level, you learn a new magic spell. Some spells are mundane, like destroying a platform, but others can devistate your opponent, like the spell that causes all the creatures in the level to attack your opponent. Powerup balls throughout the level allow you to charge your magic meter.

The music is pretty typical "sci-fi game" fare, comparible to games like Blackthorne, B.O.B., and The Lost Vikings. The sound effects are somewhat muted, though the voice that tells you "player 1 is now it" is really well done. The graphics aren't anything too special, but they do the job.

On the whole, I liked this game. Had it been released, it would be an instant 2-player classic. The controls are a bit touchy, though not terrible. I really liked the thrill of chasing your opponent down and make him "it".

One caveat about this prototype is when you die. Although there is a password system, the game tends to crash after the death scene. I guess that is why they call it a prototype. Or perhaps it is just a problem with the emulator.

I asked Darren Schebek, a programmer who worked on the game about why it was never released:

"Radical tried very hard to find a publisher for Eurit (it was an original project being developed in-house), but in the end decided that the SNES market was kaput and canned the project very close to the end of development in order to cut their losses. Instead, they adapted the game for the newer platforms. The new, pseudo-3D version became Grid Runner on the PS1, Saturn, and PC. They later created another game

DreamTR owns a prototype of this game, and has taken some shots of it. Oddly enough, the prototype cart says "property of Electronic Arts", suggesting that they may have been interested in publishing it.

Extra Innings

Players: 1 or 2 VS
_________________________

Extra Innings (known as Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League in Japan) is a baseball game released for the North American Super NES. The game did not use real life teams from either American or Japanese baseball, instead using 12 fictional teams with all fictional players. The players are animated in a cartoony, anime type of style. In addition to these 12 teams, players can also create two custom teams, the players of which can have their names and ratings edited any number of times. For the most part, the game adhered to realistic rules of baseball, though omitting some of the more complex strategies such as the double switch.

Like many baseball games from the era in which it was developed, Extra Innings's controls were somewhat primitive. For example, unlike modern baseball games, rather than the player choosing one player to move independently, moving the D-Pad will move all players in the field in unison.

Like most baseball video and computer games, either one or two players can join in for some simultaneous action. This game is recommended for children ages 6 and up.

Gameplay Modes:

Extra Innings features 4 different types of play within the game. Players can choose from these four options:

Player VS. Computer - Player chooses a team, (or creates and uses a Custom team), and plays a single game against the computer.

Player VS. Player - Both players choose a team, (or creates and uses 1 or both Custom teams), and play a single game.

All-Star - 2 player option where players choose between the two league divisions: The "All N" League, and The "ALL A" League. Players can pick and choose team members from their respective league teams and face-off in an All-Star division league game.

Pennant Race - Single player option where player chooses a home team, and 5 computer teams, to play for the pennant. Player can choose 10, 20, 30,... up to 130 games for the pennant season. Best overall season win average clinches the pennant.

Custom Teams:

Players can create 2 custom teams within the game. When creating a custom team, players can name all the members of the team. Players also have the ability to rearrange player ratings within the team. These stats control various team aspects such as hitting, pitching, speed, etc. Each of the two custom teams is alloted a certain number of points that can be alloted as the player chooses across the team's entire roster.

Custom teams can be played in all the gameplay areas except All-Star mode. In All-Star mode, only the regular pre-made teams can be used.

Tips:

Always Be Home Team
While selecting your teams hold down Select 

Sound Test
Go to the Mode Select screen, highlight Set-Up, hold L + R and press Start.

Turbo Mode
At the Team Select screen Hold down L and R.

Piergeiron, the chief Lord of Waterdeep, has called the party to a meeting and gives you the following letter:

Piergeiron,

I have investigated your concerns, my friend, and I am afraid the news is not good. More than that, it is maddening and frustrating. The signs of evil are clear, as you know, and growing. Before I left I heard rumors of assassins in the city, by Tyr. In Waterdeep! I am not sure what to believe anymore.

I have visited both Amn and Calisham, these cities have given us trouble in the past. I suspected that our problems now might be their doing, but I find no evidence of it. My informants seem clear on this point at least. None have even heard of our elusive Xanathar. No, these traces of evil are not from outside Waterdeep, but from within... or perhaps below? My magics did detect the evil, but not its source. All of our attempts to find its cause have been for naught.

The only thing we have "learned" is that the name Xanathar recurs with grave persistence. Where have we NOT looked, Paladinson my friend? Where is it the City Watch never patrol? Where would YOU hide from the Watch and the Lords of Waterdeep without leaving the area of the city? I can only think that we are overlooking something under our very noses.

I will return to the Council soon, my investigations here are clearly fruitless. But do not wait for me -- hire adventurers as the others have suggested. They may not have our biases. Perhaps a new outlook will help.

Your trusted friend,
Khelben

--From the SNES AD&D Eye of the Beholder instruction manual.

Overview:

Go and destroy the beholder that is holding the town "hostage".

Eye of the Beholder has a never-ending quality about it. Just when you think you have beaten a level, you can find secret areas. The game play is outstanding, almost perfectly imitating the real AD&D game. The graphics are good, and so is the sound quality. A very good game in all respects, and true to the game of AD&D.

Directions:

Build the best party you can to ensure victory. I find that diversity is key. You never know when you are gonna need someone from a different walk of life. High stat points for your characters help a lot too.

Be sure to check all parts of a dungeon to be sure you don't miss any important items or weapons. Be sure to talk to everyone, because information is vital in an RPG. Always keep your characters' best gear equipped. Check the stats on their weapons and armor often. Also, you want to be sure to camp and memorize your spells as soon as you start, because there may not be time later.

You are in first person view and must use the point and click controls. When you come upon an enemy, your front two men will be the only ones that can reach the enemy to attack. So be sure your fighters are in the front, and your spell casters are in the back. To fight, you must click on the appropriate fighter's weapon, and he will attack. Alternate between your two front men to optimize your attack. While the first is attacking, move your cursor to the other fighter's weapon so you can click it as soon as possible. 

Controls:

A Button - Choose
B Button - Back
Start Button - Start Game
Select Button - Select

In the latter half of the 20th century, Mankind was gripped by the fear of being invaded by extraterrestrials. They referred to extraterrestrial spacecraft as UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects). Now to those of us who live in this day and age, this sounds like a fairy tale.

It is now the year 2560, and due to the human race's countless encounters with alien life forms throughout the Universe, Earth's social framework has expanded to cosmic proportions. Now, trade, technology transfer and cultural interchange are carried out on an interplanetary basis.

The multibillionaires who earned their enormous wealth through intergalactic trade, while satisfied with their rich lifestyles, also yearned for new entertainment to stimulate their lazy lives. Their wishes were met by a call for a new project based upon a seemingly simple premise--"Why not hold, on a galactic scale, some competition like the F-1 races once held on Earth centuries ago?"

At once, everyone jumped at this idea. Rich merchants from cities in the clouds or asteroids with almost uninhabitable environments invested their wealth in the construction of racing circuits.

These racing circuits were located as high up as 300 feet above ground and held in place by anti-gravitational guide beams on both sides of the course. The racing machines developed for these tracks used the very latest in super-magnetic technology and were designed to travel without wheels, hovering one foot above the course track.

When the first Grand Prix race was held, people were angered at the brutality of the competition. The organizers had, during construction, placed various obstacles and traps along the raceway. But as time passed, and people grew used to these dangers, they soon demanded even more excitement in the race. In time, winning this race meant earning the highest honor that could be bestowed on anyone in the Universe.

In a very short time, people came to call this Grand Prix simply "F-Zero".

Directly from the F-Zero instruction booklet (pg. 3 & 4) ?1991, 1997 Nintendo of America, Inc.

Good fast Mode 7 racer. This is where the intense F-zero X and F-zero GX come from. The controls are smooth and in no time you'll be rounding that curve and flying off the road to your death with no one to blame but yourself. Good old-school fun.

Directions:

Depending on who you pick to race as you'll start in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place at the start. It doesn't matter much but

- Fire Stingray 1st

- Blue Falcon 2nd

- Wild Goose 3rd

- Golden Fox 4th

After the countdown burn rubber(or magnetic field as it may be) by holding the B button.

If you need to slow down or take a tight turn letting go of the B button and jamming on the Y button will help. After you complete a lap you get a boost. You can save it up, or use it with A. L and R drift you left or right

Every track has these features,

Repair Strip- If you take damage just race over the glowing strips on the track for a quick health boost.

Anti-Gravity Guidebeam- This is the railing that stops you from going off the track. If you touch it you'll slowdown, bounce, and take damage.

Jump Plates- If you're moving fast enough when you hit these you'll fly into the air. Hold down to fly further. DON'T LAND OUTSIDE THE TRACK! It means instant death.

Other hazards include Sand and Ice, which will mess with your traction. 

Controls:

A Button - Boost
B Button - Accelerate
X Button - Nothing
Y Button - Brake
L Button - Drift Left
R Button - Drift Right
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Nothing

Hints:

Unlock Master Class
Beat the game on Expert Class with 1st place on every track. (any league)

The player must save money in order to enter races and to research better racing equipment. The player must go through the C division, Formula 3000, and eventually to Formula One. In order to accomplish all this, the player must practice really hard and win all the races in a circuit. It all starts out with strange courses, but it eventually leads back to the familiar Formula One courses once the player has won all the Group C and Formula 3000 races. Once the player is in Formula One, he must choose one of three teams. Engines to choose from include Ford, Honda, and Ferrari.

In addition to all this, the player must race all the courses in a certain order and can no longer choose the order in which to do those races. The Formula One portion of the game uses a season standings system in addition to keeping the times of individual races. The object of the game changes from simply winning the races to acquiring as many points as possible in order to win the championship.

Banging up the car, frequently usage of the pit stop, and careless mistakes will destroy championship hopes just like in the real Formula One. Not even cheat codes can guarantee a top ranking in the overall standings, just winning individual races and utilizing strong overtaking moves while preserving the body and tires of the player's chosen vehicle.

Processing Chip:

The game cartridge included a ST010 chip; a chip created by Seta for general functions and handling the intelligence of the computer cars. This chip offered unprecedented realism in the way that computer controlled-cars could perform aggressive manoeuvers with the speed and accuracy of real Formula One drivers. In addition to this, the chip allowed the game's artificial intelligence to perform tricks that were impossible to do with other racing video games released either during or before 1993. Only through the release of the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo 64 did the level of artificial intelligence in the console system made this special chip obsolete.

Have you ever dreamed of being a Formula 1 racer? Have you fantasized about modifying your car to go faster and turn sweeter than any of the others? Have you imagined taking your F1 racer all around the world and becoming the best racer ever? Then look no further, because at least you can play a game where you can do all that, 'cause you know it's never gonna happen in real life. I mean honestly, did you really think it would?

F1 ROC is a fun racing game that lets you customize your racer and make it better than the other cars on the track. The graphics of this game were good for its time, however it's not the best SNES game as far as graphics go. The music is alright however, much like in other racers, the music only plays on the title and menu screens and is silent during gameplay. Despite that this is a fun racer that I highly recommend.

Directions:

F-1 ROC is a fun and simple game to play. Start the game by choosing if you want to play Grand Prix or Single race. With Single race you get to choose which track you run, and then you spend a predetermined amount of money modifying you car. You car, however, does not keep its modifications for the next race.

In Grand Prix however, you race on all the tracks from America to Japan and even countries like Portugal. You earn money depending on what place you finish the race in, and with that money add modifications to your car such as a better engine, suspension, tires, and other car parts. Then all you do is get racing and have a blast. So sit down, log in, and have fun.

F-1 World Championship Edition isn't a superb game, but it's still fairly fun. The graphics are unremarkable for 1995, and the gameplay isn't very deep. You can't even upgrade your car's parts or adjust its settings. The arcade-style play control is OK, but you lose too much speed when you leave the course, and it's needlessly difficult to pass another car.

You are about to enter FaceBall 2000 where you may compete with a friend one- on-one in the Arena, or tackle the ever more difficult challenges of the CyberZone.

In CyberZone, thc object is quite simple: defeat the Master Smiloid and become the new CyberZone Champion. To do this, you must make your way through 41 challenging levels filled with Power-Ups and hostile Smiloids.

In the Arena, play a computerized version of tag. The first player to get ten "tags" is the winner, at least until the next match begins. You may also try your hand (or face) against a selection of Smiloids. One or two players may play free-for-all or on a team.

--From the SNES Faceball 2000 instruction manual.

Tips:

Cyberscape (Puzzle Mode)
Hold down L & R while selecting the number of players, then let go when the screen fades to black.

Cyberzone Cheat Menu
At the Cyberzone starting level selection screen, hold L and R and press Start.

Hidden Warp Rooms
Start a Game in 'Cyberscape' mode. On Level 1 ('Find the Exit'), when you see the exit (It's a flashing wall) shoot it 5 times. You'll magically warp to another part of the level with a Speedup Pod, an 9 Extra Lives Pod, and exits to levels 10, 15, 20, and 25.  If you shoot the Nine Lives Pod three times, there will be a key inside. Take it and another part of the room will open, with a Speedup Pod, a Automag Pod, a Level 3 Armor Pod, Warp doors to levels 30, 35, 40, and a Rover enemy.  You'll note that like the Nine Lives Pod before it, the Armor Pod didn't disappear when you took armor from it.  Travel around the corner and you should face a dead end. (The exit to level 40 will be at a 90-degree angle to this wall, on the right.) Shoot that wall once, and then touch it. Travel back around the
corner to the former Armor Pod, Touch it once, and then shoot it twice to get a key that will open that wall.  On the other side are Automag, Speedup and Armor Pods, as well as two Bouncers and warps to levels 60 and 65.  Finally, go near the East wall of this room. (It's near the small 'block' on your map.) Move slightly to the left of the center, then touch that part of the wall five times, then shoot it once to open the final secret portion of the level. Just inside the Room is a warp to Level 71, but also Two Ninjas, a Guard, a Vampire, and a Kamikaze...

Famicom Detective Club: Part 2
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Satellaview Download
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Adventure , Fictional
Release Year: 2004
Original Title: Famicom Tantei Club Part II
Translated By: Neo Demiforce, Tomato
Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
This is a remake of one of Nintendo's most famous Famicom Disk System titles. Famicom Detective Club II tells the story of a nameless fellow (you), who is taken under the wing of Shunsuke Utsugi, a private detective, after he is found on the street escaping from the police. Your character is assigned a case by Utsugi - to locate the person that murdered a schoolgirl near a waterway.

And that's all I can say without spoiling the game!

You play this just like those classic Sierra text adventures: you go around places and ask people questions, check evidence, and dig up clues from within the crime scenes. It may seem tiring at first, but as the game goes on, the story keeps getting better and better.

If you're a fan of detective stories in general, you'll love this game.

Translation Description:

The script for this investigation game looks just as polished as Radical Dreamers (another Demiforce offering), and just as intriguing. There are some text errors, one of them right at the start, but it doesn't detract from the gameplay at all. That means there will be updates to the patch eventually.

Also of note is that ChrisRPG of RPGOne helped with the bootup intro (the black and white picture); the art itself was made by Emilio (of www.emiliolab.net).

Family Dog
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Action , Side-Scrolling
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Imagineering
Publisher: Malibu Games
_________________________
*
Family Dog is the story of an average suburban family, the Binfords, as told through the eyes of their dog. It first appeared as an episode of the TV show Amazing Stories, then was expanded into a very short-lived series of its own.

In the original Amazing Stories episode, a dog (simply called "the dog") is the main character, portrayed in three stories: The first involves general misadventures in the house, with him being both ignored and somewhat mistreated by his owners. The second is a "home movie" showing their Christmas (the family narrates), which culminates with the dog eating the turkey. In the third robbers break into the family's house twice, so the father sends the dog to attack dog school to learn how to become a "quivering, snarling, white-hot ball of canine terror" and fend off burglars.

Historical Note:

Although it may seem strange to the modern reader, Spielberg's choice to make the episode using animation  especially combining the expense of high-quality animation with well-known voice actors  was considered risky and bold at the time. By the mid-1980's, animation was generally relegated to "cartoons for kids", with most animation (and virtually all animation for television) done as cheaply as possible, with low quality production and no-name actors. In retrospect, "Family Dog" is often considered to be a landmark production that, combined with films like An American Tail (1986), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), and The Little Mermaid (1989), led to the 1990s rennaissance in animation (see also: Modern animation in the United States). "Family Dog" is also notable as Spielberg's first animated project; he has followed up with projects like "Tiny Toon Adventures", The Prince of Egypt, and CGI projects like Shrek.

CBS Series:

After the success of the Amazing Stories special, a CBS series was produced by Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton (who also contributed character designs), written by Dennis Klein, and distributed by Nelvana, but notably lacking the involvement of the original Writer/Director, Brad Bird. Largely hyped due to the involvement of Spielberg, the series suffered noted production delays. Upon debut the show was roundly panned for its crude scripts and cheap production values, both of drastically lesser quality than the episode which had spawned the series. After the first two episodes aired, it was pulled from the CBS schedule. Remaining episodes were sold to local markets as program filler. The entire series was later released as a Laserdisc box-set.

The Video Game:

The show was later turned into a quirky Super Nintendo game about the life of an everyday family dog. The player has to go places such as a beach and a dog pound to defeat stereotypical obstacles and enemies like dog catchers and cats.

"Survey Says... A Good Game!"

I have been watching Family Feud for about six years now, and I must say, it easily one of my favourite game shows. I have watched episodes with Richard Dawson, Ray Combs, and Louie Anderson. So, I was eager to try this game... very eager! I was a tad disappointed with the visuals and sound, but the gameplay more than makes up for it!

Graphics - 5/10
Not very impressive, but in a gameshow adaptation, visuals are barely even needed. Not at all. The families look cheesy and odd, especially when they clap (their shoulders don't even move!). But, I found myself paying less attention to the graphics, as in this game, they are not important at all.

Sound - 6/10
Once again, a mediocre department, but as I said earlier, it is not needed. The ''Think'' music is just plain annoying, as well as... well, that's the only music in the game, pretty much. They have the theme, which was a nice touch, and found myself humming along to it at times. The sound clips were few and sounded as if they were recorded through a pillow, but for an early, SNES game... good job, GameTek!

Gameplay - 9/10
Just great!!! Gameplay follows the TV show. There is the ''Bullseye Round'', which determines the amount of moeny you are eligible to win in the ''Fast Money'' round. Then on to the normal rounds, where you must come up with the most popular answers for each question... and there are lots of them! And onto the most interesting I find, ''Fast Money''. Here, you must give the most popular answers to each to each question, but you have only two shots at each of the five questions. The object is to rack up 200 points by the end of the round, then you win the money accumulated in the ''Bullseye'' round! That's quite fun! Then you start over! It's better with two players!

Overall, I found this game quite enjoyable. If you are able to sacrifice visuals and sound for gameplay, then this game is for you. And if you are/were a fan of the show, play it. It is one of the best, if not the best, video-game adaptation of a game-show out there! If you can find it, I encourage you to but it. And no, for any Richard Dawson fans, there is NO kissing in this game!

Fatal Fury Special is an updated version of Fatal Fury 2 and features many of the same graphics and gameplay, although some slight changes were made to the system, including faster game speed and an all new combo system.

The character roster of Fatal Fury 2 returns. The four computer-only characters from the previous game (Billy Kane, Axel Hawk, Laurence Blood, and Wolfgang Krauser) can now be controlled by the player, and three characters from the original Fatal Fury (Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, and Geese Howard) return, increasing the number of playable characters to 15. Ryo Sakazaki, the protagonist of Art of Fighting, appears as a hidden opponent at the end of the single player mode and is playable in the home versions.

Unlike the previous Fatal Fury games, Special allows the player combine or "combo" their attacks. When an attack lands, the player will have a brief moment of invincibility . The number of Line Move Attacks have also increased. This time pressing the light punch or light kick button while the opponent is on an opposite line will perform a Low Line Jump Attack.

The single player mode has the player fighting all of the 15 playable characters, beginning with the eight regular characters from the previous game, as well as Tung and Duck, with the player given a choice in their first opponent. After the first ten opponents, the player will fight against Billy, Axel, Laurence, Geese, and Krauser, in that order. If the player wins every match in two rounds, then the player will be challenged by Ryo Sakazaki in one final "Dream Match".

Tips:

Play as Ryo Sakazaki

Translated By: Magic Destiny, Stealth Translati
Version: 1.01
_________________________

FEDA, I believe, is one of those games that could have done well if it had been published in the USA. It is a strategy RPG with a lot of depth, and is probably most similar to the Shining Force series published by Sega. The game has some kickin' graphics, but the music is kinda ho-hum, but I'm playing it on an emulator so it probably sounds totally cool on a real SNES. Anyway, give the game a try, I'm sure you'll totally love it. Unless you're Spinner 8. Then you'll try it and totally die a lot.

Translation Description:

The background of the English version of Feda is really the story of one man's efforts that span a number of years, perhaps a decade or more. Along with many people in the 1980s and 90s, Bongo` (his translation community name) became enamored with video games, specifically role playing games (RPGs), and soon discovered that a treasure trove of outstanding Japanese RPGs would never be ported to the western world. Unlike most RPG players, however, Bongo` possessed a unique skill in computer code savvy and program writing, and putting himself in even rarer company, he dedicated those skills to endeavors such as creating an English patch for Feda, his long term signature project.

FIFA International Soccer has it all... experience sheer brilliance!

Known as EA Soccer during development and sometimes subsequently also known as FIFA '94, the first game in the series was released in the weeks leading up to Christmas 1993. This greatly hyped football title broke with traditional 16-bit era games by presenting an isometric view rather than the more usual top-down view (Kick Off), side view (European Club Soccer), or bird's-eye view (Sensible Soccer). It only includes national teams, and real player names are not used. A notorious bug allows the player to score directly from an opposing goal kick by standing in front of the goalkeeper so that the ball rebounds off him into the net. The Sega Mega CD version includes some features used in the next title, and is a highly polished version of the original. The game on the 3DO console spotted pseudo-3D cameras and it was the most graphically advanced version.

Five Airships speed across the sky. The Red Wings, the air force of the Kingdom of Baron headed by Captain Cecil, are on their way back to Baron after completing a mission in Mysidia.

Cecil reflects back on an event which took place only hours ago. Although it was the King's order, Cecil and his men feel guilty about taking the Crystal from the people of Mysidia. But Cecil reminds them all that they are the proud and mighty Red Wings of Baron.

Still questioning the royal command, Cecil brings the Crystal to the King of Baron. He starts to leave, but decides to ask the King of his intentions.

Accused of disloyalty, Cecil is removed from his post in the Red Wings and is ordered to go hunt the Summoned Monster in the Misty Valley to the northwest of Baron. Kain, the captain of the Dragoons, tries to defend his friend. But he too, is ordered to go with Cecil to fight the monster, and to deliver a package to the Village of Mist.

Cecil apologizes to Kain for involving him. But Kain does not blame him. "The King will return you to the Red Wings after this mission," says Cecil before parting.

--From the SNES Final Fantasy 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

The story of Final Fantasy 2 follows Cecil, a soldier of the Red Wings who gets banished from his kingdom for having the courage to speak out against the questionable actions of his king. Cecil is more the classic hero as opposed to the hip, rabble-rousing brats that Square favours as its Final Fantasy protagonists these days. As the plot unfolds, Cecil matures and evolves from a straightforward military man into a knight with a broader purpose and worldview, just as the game's story becomes more involved and sprawling as well. The cast of supporting characters is small but interesting, and it's a shame that their personalities are compromised at times by awkwardly translated dialogue. The most sympathetic of the companions has to be Kain, a Dragoon knight and friend of Cecil who struggles throughout the game with guilt over his love for Rosa, Cecil's girlfriend, and his betrayal of Cecil while under the mind-control spell of the villain Golbez.

Final Fantasy 2 features upgraded graphics and sound, in a new story with the classic style of the original.

Hints:

250 of any weapon
First, find the Avenger sword in the game, you'll need it for the trick. Equip Cecil with arrows in his right hand, and any kind of bow in his left. Get into a battle and make sure that nobody does anything. If a character's turn comes before his, have them parry (press right and the parry option will come up). Once it gets to Cecil's turn, enter the item screen. Grab the arrows he has equipped and bring them down to an empty slot. Without leaving the window, select the Avenger sword and move it up to his BAD hand.

From there, press B to exit the items window and his commands will disappear because the Avenger sword causes the person with it equipped to be berserked. Don't have any other characters do ANYTHING! Just let Cecil beat up all the enemies. After the battle, go to the Equip screen for Cecil. Move the Avenger sword to an empty slot, and then without leaving the screen move the sword you would like to duplicate 250 times into his right hand. De-equip, and re-equip, and you should have a sword with a circle and number next to it in your inventory. This trick must be followed TO THE LETTER.

I'm fairly certain anyone with even a mild interest in Final Fantasy IV knows that the Easy Type version, which was released in Japan at about the same time the US got its Final Fantasy II, has many interesting changes that aren't present in any other version of the game. Nonetheless if you spend enough time on forums you will inevitably find people who use "Easy Type" and "Final Fantasy II" interchangeably, as if they were identical to one another, despite all the evidence to the contrary available via a quick search online.

However, this erroneous claim is what inspired me to make this hack. Every byte of data that was changed for Easy Type has been ported to the 1.1 revision of Final Fantasy II US, text changes have only been made for the two new swords and anything else that needed text, the rest of the game is left entirely intact. This is as close to what we would have gotten in 1991 had Final Fantasy II US been a localized version of Easy Type. I hope you enjoy playing through this under-appreciated version of Final Fantasy IV.

Tips:

Unsealed Dark Elf's Cave
I'm sure most of you remember that if you use weapons, armor, or accessories made out of any metal or any silver in the Dark Elf's cave. However, there's a little glitch that can be exploited if you don't feel like using wooden gear or your bare hands to fight.  Simply put, make sure all metallic/silver equipment is unequipped before the start of any random battle. Then when you get into battle, equip your metal weaponry(and shields, if you want) and you won't be paralyzed for that battle! Just remember to unequip the items after the battle and before the next battle
and you can dominate your way through the Dark Elf's cave! As far as I know, this works in the Playstation and WonderSwan re-releases, too, but I know for a fact it works in the original FFII and FFIV carts.

250 of a weapon!
OK, this glitch is a way to get 250-255 of a weapon.  However, make sure you follow my directions EXACTLY how
I say to, or else the trick will not work.  To start the trick, you need the Avenger sword, which you can find in the Sylvan cave in the underground, I think.  First, equip Cecil with arrows in his GOOD hand, and the any kind of bow in his BAD. Get into a battle (preferably an easy one), and make sure that nobody does anything. If a character's turn comes before his, have them parry (press right and the parry option will come up). Once it gets to Cecil's turn, enter the item screen. Grab the arrows he has equipped and bring them down to an empty slot. Without leaving the
window, select the Avenger sword and move it up to his BAD hand.  From there, press B to exit the items window and his commands will disappear because the Avenger sword causes the person with it equipped to be berserked.
Don't have any other characters do ANYTHING! Just let Cecil beat up all the enemies.  After the battle, go to the Equip screen for Cecil.  Move the Avenger sword to an empty slot, and then without leaving the screen move the sword you would like to duplicate 250 times into his GOOD hand (the one with the numbers). De-equip, and re-equip, and voila!  You should have a sword with a circle and a number next to it in your inventory. If not, make sure
you followed my directions EXACTLY.  This works well for duplicating the Excalibur, and having Edge throw it for massive damage. Happy gaming!

How to skip the Sealed Cave
This has to be done right after the battle with Golbez in the underworld, right after the battle you get Rydia back. You cast Warp and you return to the Crystal Room with the Crystal returned. Doing this makes you completely eliminate the quest of the Sealed Cave.

No MP cost Sylph spell
Once you have the Sylph spell, simply arrange Rydia's spell list so that Sylph is in the top-right corner.  Whenever you cast the spell, Rydia will not lose any MP. Note, though, that if Rydia does not have at least 25 MP (the normal casting cost), you will not be able to select the spell for casting.

Unlike the duplicate weapon trick, this glitch DOES NOT work in the PlayStation re-release (Final Fantasy Chronicles).

Obtain the hidden summons quicke
The Mage and Bomb summon spells are very random to archive after a battle with either a bomb or mage.  Hunting them down can very time consuming especially with a low encounter rate. A good way to enhance the chances of receiving it is with multiple kills in only one battle. You will need a lot of phoenix downs for this.  In a battle with either a mage or bomb (there must at least be two), memorize the party's attack order. With one member, select to kill the enemy. The next party member should IMMEDIATELY select a phoenix down and place it on the enemy. The result will be the enemy is killed and then resurrected by the next party member. You may repeat this for as many phoenix downs as you have, then finish the battle. The amount of treasure you earn will be a lot greater, and
you will most likely earn a bomb or mage spell in the process.

Item Duplication
Firstly make sure you have the item you want to duplicate, and enter a battle and select the item option of the person with the item you wish to duplicate.  Then Scroll down to a blank space on the item list and press A to place a glove there, scroll back up to the equipped items then press A on the one you'll be duplicating, then press B to leave the screen.  Next, hold the L and R buttons to run from the battle, press X to see the subscreen, select Equip and the character who has the item, press A on empty spot the item used to occupy, then press A on the actual
item that's now in the items list. You will now see that your character has two of the selected item equipped.

War of the Magi

Beings of pure magic once ruled the world with power and command. But power rarely leads to contentment... A dispute amongst these beings turned into an all-out war. Beasts of doom, known as Espers, were unleashed to do the bidding of their masters. This "War of the Magi" reduced the world to smoldering rubble. When it ended, the Espers were gone, as were most of the citizens of the world.

Many centuries have passed since the war. Civilizations have been rebuilt with iron, machines and technology. For years the Espers have existed only in ancient legends. Now, an Esper has been discovered and the forces of magic are beginning to return. The risk of another, more devastating war is growing.

--From the SNES Final Fantasy 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

Final Fantasy is one of the biggest games of all time. Almost all the Final Fantasy games rocked, and Final Fantasy 3 is no different. This is the first Final Fantasy to take place in the future rather than the past. It's a pretty interesting addition to the Final Fantasy series, so check it out.

Directions:

Like any RPG, you'll want to talk to all the people you see and kill every monster. Listen to what people say or you will find yourself dying a lot!

To use multiplayer mode, you go to the config screen and change it from single to multi, then hit A and assign to the controllers. It only works for the battles though, not the regular game-play. 

Controls:

A Button - Accept
B Button - Cancel
X Button - Bring up Menu
L and R Buttons - Hold both while in battle to run
D-pad Left in Battle - Row -- Move Character between Front and Back row
D-pad Right in Battle - Def. -- Defense (reduce damage from next physical attack)
Start Button - Pause Battle
Select Button - Nothing

Hints:

Easily Kill Bosses
If you have the spells Vanish and Doom (or X-Zone), you need just cast Vanish on the enemy you want to destroy (this makes all magic hit 100%) then use Doom or X-Zone.

Final Fantasy 3 Eviltype is a patch of Final Fantasy 3 designed to completely rebalance the overall game, in such a way that it is as hard as reasonably possible without making it impossible for a theoretical newcomer to the game to still complete without unbelievable amounts of effort.

In less cheaply ripped-from-the-readme terms, Final Fantasy 3 Eviltype's goals are to both vastly increase the game's overall challenge, and to increase the usefulness of characters and equipment that were, in the author's opinion, somewhat flawed.

The degree of changes vary, for how notable they are; Does anyone remember how the Epee was totally forgettable? Probably not, they forgot it. On the other hand, how many people noticed how, well, mediocre Umaro was? Quite a few people. These are the things Eviltype attempts to rebalance into more useful forms.

It attempts to do this by improving the flawed issues, though; Only a scant handful of negative "nerfs" were added(Three spells, one removed steal, and one altered Rage.), and only when they were felt absolutely necessary.

But don't think this is going to be an easier trip because of this. Every single monster has been vastly improved on durability, damage, skillset, you name it, it's been improved?except when you least expect it, and often how you least expect it!

Hopefully, you'll enjoy it. Regardless, the goal I set out for when I made it was completed when I finished it; I enjoyed it. ^_^

Final Fantasy IV
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)

Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 2001
Players: 1
Original Title: Final Fantasy IV
Translated By: J2e Translations
Version: 3.21
_________________________
*
Final Fantasy IV was released here in the States as Final Fantasy II, and was the game to firmly establish Square as an RPG force to be reckoned with. Sadly though, the release was plagued by censors, edits, and a pretty godawful translation. Later Squaresoft rereleased FFIV in the States for Playstation as part of Final Fantasy Chronicles, complete, uncensored, and retranslated. Making an SNES translation kind of unnecessary in this day and age. But honestly, before that came along, how else were you supposed to check out the super-cool Programmer's Room? That's right.

You play the part of Cecil, commander of the Baron's airship fleet, known as the Red Wings. You've served your king faithfully over the years, but recently he's been acting weird and demanding that you retrieve the Crystals from all over the world, and by using any means necessary. Cecil questions the king's judgement and is stripped of his command. What follows is a pretty nifty (and kinda weird) tale of good vs. evil, with some love and loss thrown into the mix. Granted, it's not the first FF game to have a decent plot, but it's the first to be a good game along with that.

FFIV was the last truly traditional Final Fantasy game, with all the characters learning specific skills when they reached a certain level. Just like Dragon Quest! These days the game may not look like much (admit it, the graphics aren't too hot except for all the cool Mode7 stuff), but the gameplay is engaging, and the story keeps you playing. And the soundtrack is pretty sexy as well.

Translation Description:

This translation is very impressive, especially with the 3.21 update that fixes lots of bugs and makes the translation near-perfect. Of course it's received tremendous criticism due to Trainspotter's script revisions; though I personally don't mind them that much, apparently some people demand an untouched Japanese game to play in English.

Tips:

Adamant Armor
Use Alerts in the L-Shaped room in the Lunar Underground 5th floor to summon Pink Puffs. There is a 1/64 chance that they will drop a Pink Tail. Take this tail to the Adamant Grotto for Adamant, then head for the blacksmith's house, located underground, to get the Adamant Armor.

Item Duplication
You will only be able to duplicate items that can be held in the Left Hand or Right Hand. A great way to get loads of Excaliburs to throw. Go into battle. Now select an empty slot in your item list. Now keep pressing UP until you get to the equipment list for the Left and Right Hand. Select the item that you want to duplicate. Now escape from the battle by holding L + R. Open up the menu and go to the character equipment. Re-equip your item. You will notice it has a '2' next to it. De-Equip it and then Re-equip it, to 'split it in half. '

Developer's Room
Yes, there is a hidden Developers' Room, and it's in the hardtype version of FFIV, so here's how you get to it!

Go to the Dwarven Castle in the underworld. Get to the room where you can buy weapons and armor; there is a path in between both those counters. Walk up into the Rally-ho Pub. There, walk directly to the right (around the table of course) and you'll see an odd blackish section of floor. Walk right through the wall at that point and continue right and down the steps into the hidden Developers' Room!

There is also a hidden porn magazine in this room as well. Get into the Nap Room (from the entrance to the
room, go up and right, then down into the Nap Room). Check out the left side of the bookcase nearby to find Smut, which is the magazine. Select it on the Item menu and the screen will turn purplish as Cecil looks at it... Then after it's over, the screen's back to normal and the Smut is gone

This is a hack based on the J2E translation of Final Fantasy 4. I loved playing the original version but there were several changes J2E made that in my opinion seemed to change the feel of the game. This hack changes these things to look more like Final Fantasy 2 US.

Changes

- Changed the font to the original 8-8 font.

- renamed a few spells and items.

- changed names such as Golbeze to Golbez.

- changed in battle dialogue and item/spell box from two lines to one line.

- rearranged some text on the status screens.

This ROM hack alters the game into a story mostly centered on characters from at least one other game in the Final Fantasy series, notably Celes and Terra.

The game was modified to a large degree. Both graphics (mainly character graphics) and text were modified. One character was even changed into a totally new character.

The text was changed from a base script of J2E's translation of the game. The game is now more female related. It is also a bit sapphic in nature, centering on the relationship of Celes and Terra.

This is the "Core Hack" meaning it's not the whole game. What it is though is a large series of modifications I made to the game with help from other contributors which I'll list in the credits below.

This hack contains:

- New Title Screen

- New Characters

- New Spells

- New Lores (Replaced to "Weave")

- New Dialog/Menu Font

- New Item Icons

- New Items

- New Content

- Hold "B" to run.

- Vicks/Wedge start with all Magitech skills.

- "Annihilated" changed to Owned.

- Psycho Cyan fix.

- "Summon" ability now works.

- "Sword Tech" is now sped up.

- Names are now lower case.

You may be wondering what "Weave" is, well when you combine two elements, it makes a new spell. This is what I call a "Spell Weave", original or not I liked the idea and implemented it.

This hack was mainly made for rom hackers who hack bosses or for any other use which pertains to rom hacking.

 Credits 

- Dragonsbrethren for Magitek Enhancement Patch and help with title screen.

- Lenophis for Esper Battle Menu Fix patch, "Summon This!" and helping me understand a lot of stuff.

- ArmorVil for Cyans Sword Tech tweak.

- Assassin for Alphabetized Rage tweak.

- Anyone else I forgot.

- Me, for making this possible.

Final Fantasy V
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1998
Players: 1
Original Title: Final Fantasy V
Translated By: RPGe
Version: 1.10
_________________________
*
Final Fantasy V was released in the States as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology, complete with Ted Woolsey's script that was done before the SNES Square translation was scrapped. So, at least now you have a choice in ways to play. I'd recommend the SNES game for two reasons: the translation's better (I hear.. I've played less than half an hour of the PS1 port), and the PS1 load times suck a big one. Remember that rumor before FFA was released that Woolsey changed Gilgamesh to Gargamel? Man, no one has any respect for that guy.

Anyways, FFV is pretty straightforward Final Fantasy, except for the Job System that the characters use. You have a large selection of jobs, and there's no penalty in switching from one job to another (unlike FFIII). Battles earn you points that go towards levelling up these jobs, which give you extra abilities. Pretty straightforward, right? Well? well, it is. I haven't played far enough into the game to give it a fair review, but as far as all the stuff most Square whores care about, the graphics are a small step up from FFIV, and the soundtrack is great. And it's pretty fun to play too, since the Job System gives you a lot of flexibility in building your characters, as well as multiple ways to finish those troublesome bosses. It can also be severely abused, which has resulted in multiple FAQs on the issue.

One thing I can't get over, though, is the nodding. It seems like these characters have three different animations: laughing, raising their hand, and nodding.

Translation Description:

RPGe's FFV translation is probably the most famous fan translation ever. It was the first RPG to ever be completely translated, and a lot of ROM hackers and translators today cite this project as the reason they got into the hobby. Given the project's troubled history, it's really nice to see such an overwhelmingly positive result.

In contrast to J2e's FFIV translation, which some say took too many script liberties, FFV's script is occasionally criticized for its blandness. There's just no pleasing people, is there? At least Faris doesn't say "Arr!" constantly.

Tips:

Brave Sword or Chicken Knife ?
Before venturing into the Cleft of Dimension, return to the Town of Main the southwest, a door that was previously locked is now open. Through the door is a hidden path that will lead you to a man. He will offer to give you a Brave Sword or a Chicken Knife. The Brave Sword will get stronger as you win battles and the Chicken Knife as you run from battles.

Free Potions in World II
Before venturing into the Cleft of Dimension, return to the Town of Main the southwest, a door that was previously locked is now open. Through the door is a hidden path that will lead you to a man. He will offer to give you a Brave Sword or a Chicken Knife. The Brave Sword will get stronger as you win battles and the Chicken Knife as you run from battles.

Learn your game stats
In Kelb town, enter the Inn. You'll find a man sitting on a table talk to him then sit on the chair on the LEFT (NOT in front of the man)! He'll give you some kind of wine then he'll give you an after meal gift of 8 Potions! You can repeat this to get 24 potions.

Avoiding the final battle
If you don't want to fight Neo Exdeath (the transform of Exdeath) you need to use the command Mix (an ability
of Chemist Job), then mix the items Maiden's Kiss & Holy Water to create Kiss of Blessing, then give it to Exdeath and kill him, he won't transform to Neo Exdeath & you can see the ending.

Killing carbunle in 1 hit
If you don't want to fight Neo Exdeath (the transform of Exdeath) you need to use the command Mix (an ability
of Chemist Job), then mix the items Maiden's Kiss & Holy Water to create Kiss of Blessing, then give
it to Exdeath and kill him, he won't transform to Neo Exdeath & you can see the ending.

Make the game impossible.
If you have a mystic knight on your party, cast Fire 3 and in the next round hit Carbuncle with it. It will not show any damage, but it will kill him.

Alternate Tycoon Castle Scene
In world one when you get the Hiryuu ( Dragon ) you have access to Tycoon Castle. If you go, there's a scene involving Leena and Faris where Leena suspects Faris may be her long lost sister, Sarisa, and Faris denies it. But, if you wait until after you get the airship it's an entirely different scene involving Leena's childhood.

Defeat Catastrophe easily
Before the battle with Catastrophe, equip a Wall Ring on one of your characters, and cast Float on that same character. Then, go into the battle. Whenever one of your characters is Floating, Catastrophe will always use Gravity100 to ground that character.  However, because that character has a Wall Ring, the attack will be reflected back at him. He will continue to use Gravity100 for the entire battle, allowing you to use any attacks you need to beat him without the fear of being killed.

Easy Experience and Levels in World 2
To get a relatively easy 2500 experience points and 5 AP in the second world, go to the Sealed Castle, the
one with the legendary weapons. The random monster in there, an undead-looking dragon, is very powerful and is probably not meant to be defeatable at that point. However, if you have a character that can use the Control action you can defeat him with little or no damage.  He might resist being Controlled a few times, so perhaps multiple, fast characters with the ability might be useful, but one was enough for me. He might get some attacks in before you Control him successfully, though, so prepare to heal your party and possibly cure them from the Zombie status effect.  Once you successfully Control him, he has two attacks you can make him use on himself. DON'T make him Attack himself, or he'll break out of your Control. On that note, don't let any of your party members attack him either for that same reason, plus they wouldn't make much of a difference anyway. Instead choose
him Flame attack, which will deal 4999 damage to himself! And since it's magic, he won't break your Control. He seems to have about 20, 000 HP or more, though, so it'll take five Flames to kill him. This worked for me consistently, but just remember to save often in case things don't go your way.

What this does is make monsters extremely easy to beat, in fact if you spend longer than 5 seconds in battle there must be something wrong. This patch was requested of me in 2001 by someone who didn't want to play through the game normally but still wanted to see the story unfold.

These patches were intended for those who want to participate in a good story without having to do mindless leveing and tedious battles.

Tips:

Unsealed Dark Elf's Cave
I'm sure most of you remember that if you use weapons, armor, or accessories made out of any metal or any silver in the Dark Elf's cave. However, there's a little glitch that can be exploited if you don't feel like using wooden gear or your bare hands to fight.  Simply put, make sure all metallic/silver equipment is unequipped before the start of any random battle. Then when you get into battle, equip your metal weaponry(and shields, if you want) and you won't be paralyzed for that battle! Just remember to unequip the items after the battle and before the next battle
and you can dominate your way through the Dark Elf's cave! As far as I know, this works in the Playstation and WonderSwan re-releases, too, but I know for a fact it works in the original FFII and FFIV carts.

250 of a weapon!
OK, this glitch is a way to get 250-255 of a weapon.  However, make sure you follow my directions EXACTLY how
I say to, or else the trick will not work.  To start the trick, you need the Avenger sword, which you can find in the Sylvan cave in the underground, I think.  First, equip Cecil with arrows in his GOOD hand, and the any kind of bow in his BAD. Get into a battle (preferably an easy one), and make sure that nobody does anything. If a character's turn comes before his, have them parry (press right and the parry option will come up). Once it gets to Cecil's turn, enter the item screen. Grab the arrows he has equipped and bring them down to an empty slot. Without leaving the
window, select the Avenger sword and move it up to his BAD hand.  From there, press B to exit the items window and his commands will disappear because the Avenger sword causes the person with it equipped to be berserked.
Don't have any other characters do ANYTHING! Just let Cecil beat up all the enemies.  After the battle, go to the Equip screen for Cecil.  Move the Avenger sword to an empty slot, and then without leaving the screen move the sword you would like to duplicate 250 times into his GOOD hand (the one with the numbers). De-equip, and re-equip, and voila!  You should have a sword with a circle and a number next to it in your inventory. If not, make sure
you followed my directions EXACTLY.  This works well for duplicating the Excalibur, and having Edge throw it for massive damage. Happy gaming!

How to skip the Sealed Cave
This has to be done right after the battle with Golbez in the underworld, right after the battle you get Rydia back. You cast Warp and you return to the Crystal Room with the Crystal returned. Doing this makes you completely eliminate the quest of the Sealed Cave.

No MP cost Sylph spell
Once you have the Sylph spell, simply arrange Rydia's spell list so that Sylph is in the top-right corner.  Whenever you cast the spell, Rydia will not lose any MP. Note, though, that if Rydia does not have at least 25 MP (the normal casting cost), you will not be able to select the spell for casting.

Unlike the duplicate weapon trick, this glitch DOES NOT work in the PlayStation re-release (Final Fantasy Chronicles).

Obtain the hidden summons quicke
The Mage and Bomb summon spells are very random to archive after a battle with either a bomb or mage.  Hunting them down can very time consuming especially with a low encounter rate. A good way to enhance the chances of receiving it is with multiple kills in only one battle. You will need a lot of phoenix downs for this.  In a battle with either a mage or bomb (there must at least be two), memorize the party's attack order. With one member, select to kill the enemy. The next party member should IMMEDIATELY select a phoenix down and place it on the enemy. The result will be the enemy is killed and then resurrected by the next party member. You may repeat this for as many phoenix downs as you have, then finish the battle. The amount of treasure you earn will be a lot greater, and
you will most likely earn a bomb or mage spell in the process.

Item Duplication
Firstly make sure you have the item you want to duplicate, and enter a battle and select the item option of the person with the item you wish to duplicate.  Then Scroll down to a blank space on the item list and press A to place a glove there, scroll back up to the equipped items then press A on the one you'll be duplicating, then press B to leave the screen.  Next, hold the L and R buttons to run from the battle, press X to see the subscreen, select Equip and the character who has the item, press A on empty spot the item used to occupy, then press A on the actual
item that's now in the items list. You will now see that your character has two of the selected item equipped.

This is a comedy / parody hack of Final Fantasy 5. Unlike most other "spoofs" out there, I have taken every precaution necessary to make sure this spoof doesn't end up filled with lame, juvenile humor.

My four pillars were:

- No crude humor.

- The plot must be better than FF5's.

- The characters must be believable.

- It must be funny.

I hope I have succeeded on all four, but only you can be the judge of that.

This patch makes FF5 much harder by beefing up the enemies. That's basically all that's in this version. I never finished doing anything else. So if you thought FF5 was too easy give this a try.

The Japanese version of Final Fantasy III. Or the Japanese version of Final Fantasy VI, if you played the Playstation version. Between this and FF3US, the only big difference is the title screen. Anything else is just nitpicking in the translation itself. Though I admit, Pearl instead of Holy was kind of weird. But, whaddaya going to do.

When this game first came out over here, the only chance I got to play it was on my friend's SNES when I was housesitting for him and his family while they were on vacation. There weren't any open save slots, though, and I didn't want to risk deleting one that had important stuff on it, so every day I played through the game as far as I could without saving. The farthest I got was the Lete River. Not too far, but not bad for an afternoon's work. I was absolutely enthralled by the game's story, and characters, and graphical excellence. Once SNES9x was released for the first time, I played through it again on my roommate's computer (with sound even) and got to the Floating Continent. Again, great stuff.

Once I bought Final Fantasy Anthology and was set and determined to finish the game, I realized something. While the story is decent, and the characters all have slightly more personality than most RPG characters (with notable exceptions), after the Floating Continent the game does a complete 180 on play style. Instead of following the story, you're now given full control to go wherever you want in your shiny new (old) airship, and the developers expect the gameplay to carry the game until the final dungeon. And it doesn't.

Eventually you discover Espers (or Phantom Beasts, or whatever), which work a lot like your equipment in Final Fantasy IX: in battles you get points that go to your Esper. Once your Esper reaches 100% in a particular area, your character gets a certain magic spell. The problem is, (almost) any character can equip any Esper. What the hell is the badass royal martial artist doing casting Ultima? And why can he do it just as easily as the half-esper magic user? Eventually, all that distinguishes the characters from each other is their special moves. And honestly, why would you ever not have Edgar and Sabin in your party? Granted, the whole cookie-cutter aspect isn't as bad as FFVII, but unlike FFVII, running around in dungeons, fighting monsters and solving simple puzzles, just isn't any fun. It's enjoyable at first, but by the end all the game's faults just end up being intolerable. Playing through it becomes a chore, and eventually you'll say to hell with getting the cool Espers and items, let's just fight the stupid boss already.

So in short, play until you get to the Floating Continent. You'll enjoy it more. Granted, the story and graphics are great, and the soundtrack is easily in the all-time 10 best ever, but it's hard to say whether or not having to suffer through the actual game is worth it.

Again, I did beat the game, so hopefully JCE3000GT approves of my review this time.

Translation Description:

This patch is interesting for a few reasons. For one, it's a compelete, more faithful (at least according to Sky Render) translation of Final Fantasy 6. Whether or not this is a good thing and was worthwhile will be left to the discretion of the viewer. The hacking work is superb, though, that can't be denied.

Another interesting thing about it is that ChrisRPG and Sky Render have attempted to fix a number of bugs that had passed by Square's testers and lodged themselves in the original game. These fixes are all completely optional, and can be activated by using the various patches here in the ZIP. Be sure and apply them after you apply the translation patch. Check out the readme for more details.

Tips:

Double Mp with Runic!!
Equip Celes with a Cursed Shield. If she absorbs (with runic)a spell the shield }Save anywhere in Kefka's Tower
First start by getting one of your groups onto a save point. Now cycle through the groups until you arrive back at the one on the save point. Switch groups one more time and go to the party screen and the 'Save' command should be useable (and you can even use Tents!). Even after walking around and getting into a battle, the Save command should still be available.  

Easy Level Ups
Note: you must have a turbo controller to do this trick When you make it to the Lete River, set your window commands to 'Short' and switch Banon's 'Health' and 'Attack' then switch the commands back to 'Window' so you can have Banon's Health as the default command.  When you get to a point where you have a choice of going 'Straight' or Left set your controller to turbo and tape down the A button. Leave your game on overnight and you will likely be around level 50-60.

Save a Character (spoilers)
As the world is collapsing on the Floating Continent, and you have six minutes to get off, make your way to the very end where you can jump down to the airship. Instead of jumping, wait and do not move. When there is five seconds left on the clock Shadow will appear and jump down to the airship with you instead of dying.

Save Cid
When you're supposed to catch some fish for Cid, be sure to catch the fast ones that moves around in the water and give those to Cid so he can live. If you catch the slow ones and feed them to Cid, he'll die because the slow ones are the sick fish and the fast ones are the healthy ones.

This new Final Fantasy VI hack makes quite a few changes to gameplay whilst leaving the original story intact.

This hack has increased enemy stats, given the AI new (and smarter moves) while altering equipment and Espers. Equipment has been made more unique to each character, and certain characters have new skillsets- for example, Mog has Jump instead of Attack.

Equipment has been rebalanced, meaning you won't see any more Genji Glove/Offering combos. You'll have to form strategies to deal with each boss!

Additionally, most glitch fix patches have already been applied to the game.

This hack is my first ever, and I appreciate all comments. My e-mail is in the Readme file. Have fun!

For centuries the Focus Tower had stood at the very heart of the World. It had been a center for trade and knowledge, and the people of the World had met there to peacefully settle their differences. But on one warm summer day, the Tower was suddenly transformed into a symbol of the purest evil. For on that day, powerful monsters battled their way into the Tower, stole the four Crystals of the Earth, and then took off with the magical Coins that had kept the Tower's doors unlocked.

With the Tower doors sealed behind them, the monsters relaxed their guard and turned their attention to the Crystals. As they basked in the radiant glow of the Crystals, the monsters grew stronger and meaner and even more wicked. The more light the monsters consumed, the more the World was drained of its warmth and color. Tremors soon shook the land. The sky grew cloudy and dark. The seasons went berserk. Monsters appeared everywhere and terrorized the people. The World was thrown into total chaos. Something had to be done...

Enter Benjamin. Benjamin was the most normal youngster you could imagine. Like most responsible villagers of his age, he arose at the crack of dawn to take his family's livestock to the upper meadow to graze. Other kids teased him because he read while tending his heard, and because a village Elder had taken him in as a promising student. Although Benjamin seemed mature beyond his years, he still dreamed of being more than he was -- faster, stronger and more daring. Little did he know his wishes were about to be fulfilled the hard way...

--From the SNES Final Fantasy Mystic Quest instruction manual.

Overview:

I really liked this installment in the Final Fantasy series. Mystic Quest incorporated some very cool improvements. The gameplay has been improved, letting you choose your battles, and giving more options for exploring the territory. Another improvement in Mystic Quest was the graphics. I liked the graphics in this one better than its predecessors. They looked a little more cartoonish and I like that. The sounds were pretty good too. I like it when they keep some of the same sounds and music from the older games. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is a great RPG and I suggest you direct a large portion of your life to it. Just kidding! Give it a try though.

Directions:

Save your world from evil by retrieving the four crystals and reopening the Focus Tower. 

Mystic Quest has improved the way you engage in battles. No more random encounters. You see the monsters from a distance and can choose whether or not to engage them. I think that way is more realistic. I realize you could be walking along and sometimes you would come across a sneaky monster that gets the drop on you, but not every one. I also liked the ability to jump and use your weapon on the main screen. It kinda gave it a "Zelda" mood. You could use bombs and find secret passages and other hidden things.

Hints:

Unlimited Potions
At the beginning of the game, at the first forest, there is a treasure box containing potions. Take the potions and leave the forest. Now go back to the forest and the box will be full of potions again! Repeat this process until you have as many potions as you want. You can do this in any town, forest, dungeon, etc. that has a treasure box with any healing item in it. 

Tips:

Battlefield Reset
When fighting in a battlefield against an enemy that can self destruct, make sure all but that one enemy is dead. Also, make sure your hp is low enough for the self destruct to kill you as well. Wait for the enemy to self destruct and kill both of you. The battle will end, you will gain all the experience, gp, and even the battle count will decrease, and then it will ask you to try again. Do so and repeat the previous steps until you see that you have won the prize for defeating all the enemies. Win the next battle and exit. The battlefield icon will look like one that has been cleared out and the battlefield will now say:  Battlefield Round 255 of 10.

Check SNES chips' version numbers.
In the menu screen, press START and SELECT at the same time. You should then get a box telling you which
version number all the chips in your SNES are. Afterwards, the text in the menu screens might act a bit wacky. Just exit the menu and enter it again to fix it.

Double Level From Battlefields
Usable with any battlefield that gives Experience points as a reward.  Fight in the battlefield until you have one battle left. Then, go anywhere else, and fight enemies until your experience needed for the next level is within
the range that the battlefield gives. (i. e. If the battlefield gives around 200 exp. per battle, get your needed exp. to within 200.)  Then, go back and finish the battlefield. You will gain the level with the exp. gain from the enemies, get the exp. reward, then gain another level.

Defeating Doom King Easily
Once the battle with Doom King has begun, cast Cure on him, and you'll do massive damage to the boss. You'll
do about 10,000+ to him. That's an easy win against the final boss, don't you think?

Easy Items
Go to any town, and if you find a treasure box, open it. Go out of town, then go back in. Open the box again
and the item will be available. This can be of great help when you are stocking 99 of each item.

Stronger Magic
If you have the Dragon Claw weapon equipped while attacking with magic, the magic will do more damage than normal.

Final Fight

Publisher: Capcom

Final Fight is set in the fictional American city of Metro City "sometime in the 1990s" (1989 in the Japanese arcade version). The story centers around the kidnapping of the newly-elected Mayor's daughter, Jessica, by the dominant street gang in the city known as Mad Gear, which seeks to bring the Mayor under their control. The Mayor, a former pro wrestler named Mike Haggar, refuses to give in to the gang's demands and sets out to rescue his daughter with the help of her boyfriend, a martial artist named Cody, and his friend, a modern-day Bushin ninja named Guy

Final Fight is an archetypal side scrolling beat-em-up game. One or two player characters move from left to right through each level (most of which are split into 3 or more scenes), fighting with the enemy characters who appear, until they reach a confrontation with a stronger boss character at the end of the level. Once that boss is beaten, the players automatically move on to the next stage. Enemies appear from both sides of the screen and from out of doorways or entrances set into the background, and the player(s) must defeat all of them to progress. If the players try to simply travel through the levels without fighting, the screen will stop scrolling until all current enemies have been defeated, before allowing the players to continue progress. Enemies may move outside the confines of the screen, but players may not. There is a time limit to each stage.

The control configuration is composed of an eight-directional joystick and two action buttons for "attacking" and "jumping". Pressing attack and jump simultaneously will execute the character's "deadly blow" that will strike all nearby surrounding enemies, but will consume a portion of the character's vitality. The player can execute a combination of different attacks, which can culminate with a finishing blow or grab the enemy and perform a throw. The player can also grab enemies by approaching them and deliver a series of grabbing attacks. Haggar is the only character who can grab enemies and perform a pile driver. In addition to the player's basic attacks, the player can also pick up weapons such as knives, iron pipes and Muramasa swords. Health can be restored by picking up food from the ground.

Time has passed since Mike Haggar, along with his friends Cody and Guy, defeated the Mad Gear Gang and restored peace to Metro City. While the trio has continued living their normal lives, with Cody taking a vacation with his girlfriend Jessica, Guy going off to a training journey, and Haggar continuing to run Metro City as Mayor, the surviving Mad Gear members have secretly regrouped plotting their revenge under a new leader. They begin by kidnapping Guy's fiancee in Japan, Rena, along with her father and Guy's former sensei Genryusai. With Guy nowhere to be found, Rena's younger sister, Maki, calls Haggar and informs him of the situation. Accompanied by his friend Carlos Miyamoto, Haggar travels to Eurasia and meets up with Maki, and the three of them join forces to take on the newly revived Mad Gear.

Gameplay:

Final Fight 2 does not deviate much from the original Final Fight in terms of gameplay, although unlike the SNES version of the first game (and the alternate version Final Fight Guy), Final Fight 2 features a two-player cooperative mode in addition to the single-player mode. The player has a choice between three characters: Haggar, who uses professional wrestling techniques; Maki, a female master of the fictional Bushin-ryu Ninpo, similar to Guy from the first game; and Carlos, a South American martial artist of Japanese descent who uses a sword for his Special Move. Like in the original game, each character has their own set of fighting techniques and abilities unique to each character.

The gameplay remains the same as in the original game. The player has two main action buttons (Attack and Jump), which when pressed together, makes the player's character perform their Special Move (a third button can also be assigned for this purpose). The player proceed through levels fighting against hordes of underlings before reaching a boss character at the end of each stage. Health-restoring food items and other bonus point items are hidden away in breakable drums and barrels. There are also three retrievable weapons in the game, a tonfa, a piece of lumber and a knife. There's also a "Genryusai Doll" which makes the player invulnerable for a limited period and a "Guy Doll" which gives the player an extra life.

There's a total of six stages in the game, each set in a distinct Eurasia country: Hong Kong, France, Holland, England, Italy and Japan. As in the original game, the player will face against numerous types of recurring enemy characters thorough the entire game. The only returning enemy characters from the original SNES game are the Andore family. Rolento, a boss character who was in the first Final Fight but missing in the SNES port, appears as a boss character in this game (with his name spelled "Rolent").

The player can adjust the difficulty (along with other settings) of the game in the Option Menu. Like in Final Fight Guy, each difficulty setting reveals only a certain portion of the ending, with the full ending being shown only by completing the game on the Expert setting.

Localization:

The Japanese version of Final Fight 2 features two enemy characters named Mary and Eliza, who were knife-wielding female enemies with acrobatic techniques. Mary and Eliza were replaced by two substitute characters named Leon and Roberts in the international versions of the game. Unlike Poison and Roxy (their counterparts from the original Final Fight), Mary and Eliza were characterized as actually female characters instead of transvestites. Additionally, the first stage boss Wong Wong, wields a meat cleaver in the Japanese version, which was also removed in the overseas versions.

Following the annihilation of the Mad Gear Gang, a new criminal element named the Skull Cross Gang emerges above the others as the new dominant street gang in Metro City. When Guy returns to Metro City from his martial art training to become reacquainted with his friend Mayor Haggar, the two are informed that the Skull Cross Gang has started a riot in the downtown area of the city. Joined by Lucia, an officer of the Metro City's Special Crimes Unit, and Dean, a street fighter who appears to be familiar with the Skull Cross Gang, Guy and Haggar join forces once again to save Metro City from its newest menace.

Gameplay:

The player has a choice between four characters: Guy and Haggar from the original Final Fight return, along with new heroes Lucia and Dean. As in the previous Final Fight games, each character has their own set moves, techniques and abilities unique to their character. Like in Final Fight 2, the game can be played alone or with a second player, along with an additional game mode that allows a single player be accompanied by a CPU-controlled partner.

The player has many new abilities which were not available in the previous Final Fight games. The player can now dash and performing dashing attacks or dashing jump attacks like in the previous Capcom beat-em-up Captain Commando. The player can also grab enemies from behind and perform holding and throwing attacks, as well as move while keeping the direction the player is facing locked.

The player also has access to command-based special techniques similar to the Street Fighter, including a Super move. Much like the Super Combos featured in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, the player has a Super Move gauge which fills up as the player performs their regular attacks against enemy. When gauge is filled, the player will have access to powerful Super move, which will consume the entire gauge. If the Super gauge remains for a certain period and the Super move is not used, then the gauge will be emptied automatically.

Like in the previous Final Fight games, the player has access to weapons, health-restoring food and other bonus point items, which are stored inside breakable drums. Each character in Final Fight 3 specializes in a specific and if the player picks up their character's preferred weapon, then they will have access to a unique combo attack exclusive to the character (for example, Guy specializes in using nunchaku).

There's a total of six stages in the game, each with their unique boss character. The stages in the game feature multiple paths that changes the areas the player will visit, as well as the enemies and bosses they encounter. The game's ending changes depending on the character the player is using, the path taken to reach the end of the game, and the difficulty setting.

This isn't actually Fire Emblem 3, that's just the name rom kiddies gave to it once and it stuck. It's actually a remake of Fire Emblem 1 and 2, I think. I'm not sure which system Fire Emblem 2 is for, since Fire Emblem Gaiden is in fact NOT Fire Emblem 2 and is actually a separate story unto itself. So maybe this game is, like, Fire Emblem 1, with a new story at the end, that they just kinda CALLED Fire Emblem 2, but it was a totally new game! Yeah! Okay probably not. The Fire Emblem series is enigmatic at best, I'm afraid.

Translation Description:

A mostly complete patch for Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem.

Tips:

Access the arena unlimited times
In chapter 7, after you defeat all of the enemies in the arena it will say that you have no one left to fight. However, if you leave your home castle and go to one of the castles you conquered, view the message that says there is no one left to fight at that castle, and then go back to your home castle, you can access the arena again. This way, you can easily get most of the second generation to level 30 in the first chapter you have them.

"What the Hell is this? Zelda? Pinball? Arkanoid? Gradius? A little of each? No, silly. It must be Firestriker!"

Do you remember the battle in Zelda: A Link to the Past where Link must defeat the wizard, and the only way he can hurt the foul villain is by volleying back balls of light with his sword? Well, imagine an entire game based on that idea.

That's Firestriker.

Actually, that's a bit too simplistic of a description, but you do spend the entire game hitting a ball of light into enemies. If you haven't read any other reviews of Firestriker yet, I can see how this might seem confusing, if not totally stupid. Indeed, it's hard to define the game so quickly.

You have a sword and heart meter representing your health... just like Zelda. However, you spend most of your time breaking blocks by bouncing a ball at them... just like Arkanoid. At the same time, the ball doesn't bounce around in a ping-pong fashion. Despite the top-down view of the game, it constantly drifts to the bottom of the screen... just like Pinball physics. The levels scrolls vertically, and the level bosses also undoubtedly are influenced by shoot-'em-ups. Firestriker slightly emulates all of these things, yet isn't any of them.

Saying Firestriker is unoriginal because it borrows a few concepts is like saying cake is a ripoff of flour and eggs. The game takes all of these ingredients and makes something absolutely, unquestionably original. Never before or since have I seen a game like Firestriker. The concept is absolutely fantastic.

What's unfortunate is that the concept is what carries the game. Make no mistake, the game IS fun, but given the brilliance of the concept, it should've been even better. Instead, the execution speaks loudly that this development team didn't have a lot of quality experience under their belt. The level design, the translation, the learning curve, the bosses, it all needed a lot of polish. 

Overall - 6/10

In my system, 5 is average. Anything below 5 is subpar. Anything above 5 is above par. Even though a lot about Firestriker says mediocre, it's just much too different to be labelled as average.

The game definitely isn't for everyone. I'm sure there are going to be people who play it and hate it. The presentation is sloppy at points, and the gameplay is quite repetitive-feeling for stretches at a time.

However, I think this game has an audience. There are too many over-saturated genres, both now and in the past. Sometimes, we all cry out for something different from the same old action game. This game was made for those people, and in many ways, the developers pulled off what they were trying to do. The graphics, the sound, the characters, it all looks rather bland from a screenshot review. Anyone who actually plays the game might discover a friendly diversion, even if just for an afternoon. Both the good and bad aspects of the game are unforgettable. Although, I won't exactly be sitting in the head float at the Firestriker Appreciation Parade.

Certain enemies when shot drop shield power-ups which can be either picked up to afford temporarily invincibility or detonated to destroy all enemies onscreen. Every so often a boss enemy will attack you, the destruction of these bosses will give you upgrades to your forward firing gun.  It is the sequel to the game known as SWIV in Europe.

Fireteam Rogue
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (USA)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Action , Multi-Directional , Fantasy
_________________________

Fireteam Rogue was to be released by Accolade in late 1995 - late 1996. According to the February 1995 issue of Gamepro, the game was to contain 100 hours of gameplay. You could control 5 different characters and featured varied gameplay, including action/adventure, fighting, airborne shooting, and puzzle solving.

I contacted Russell Borogove, who worked as an engineer on the game:

There were four playable characters - Chance, a human in a crystalline battle suit; Aja Dae, an elfin sorceress, Shadowblade, a sort of cat/monkey alien ninja, and Broc, a big lizard alien. We had a hell of a lot of levels in the game (the goal was, I think, 100 hours of gameplay; I don't know if we actually got there.) The levels were broken down into four regions, one for each character, but you could actually play any character in any level. In addition to the hoppy-jumpy fighting mechanics,you also played a flying arcade shooter (think Afterburner) when you went from region to region. (The landscape for the flying portion was done using the SNES "mode 7" rotate/scale hardware if I remember rightly.) There were some interesting things like switches in one region which would open doors in other regions, so you had to do a lot of back-and-forth in the game to finish.

The project had a lot of problems in development. We spent a lot more time developing ridiculous data compression schemes to fit all the levels into the game, when we should have cut a couple of enemies and a handful of levels in order to get it done. There were also some personality conflicts that culminated with the producer of the project quitting when we were at beta. Shortly after that, the head of product development at Accolade asked us if we thought we should continue the project or not. It was unclear to me how much more work it was going to take to finish it and if the game was going to be good enough to compete in the market by the time we actually got it out, and I advised that we should shut it down. I don't remember what the others said.

"My recollection is that we did not complete the game before it was officially killed - I know that conflicts with Betty Cunningham's version of the story. I could well be wrong, though. The game was definitely playable, but I think there were still some showstopping bugs in it.

I assume that Atari (via Infogrames, via Accolade) now holds all the FTR intellectual property, and probably no one now at Atari knows anything about it. :)"

Well, finally the prototype for Fireteam Rogue has been dumped, and is now ready for release. Thanks goes to Carnivol and Li Wang for donating this piece of SNES history to the community. This prototype was originally aquired from a former game magazine employee. It found its way to DreamTR, who in turn sold this as he had two copies.

The game is in a deep alpha state, and only one level shows any semblance of completeness. The character animation is jerky, and the controls are not all that responsive. The graphics are decent enough, though there isn't a whole lot of variety. The music in the game is actually pretty good, though there is a bug that it will turn off almost immediately after starting the level. This is remedied by going into the start menu and toggling the sound option. The most complete level is the Shadowblade's, though even it gets to the point where you can't proceed. It is unfortuate that it isn't more complete, as it sounds as though Accolade had plenty of levels for the game. Anyways, give it a shot. Maybe someday we will see a more complete version of it.

First Samurai
Platform: Super NES

Genre: Action , Side-Scrolling , Fantasy
Release Year: 1993
Developer: KEMCO
Publisher: KEMCO
_________________________

When the Demon King comes down from his mountain to kill you, your master fights him and is cut down. As his last act of desperation, he summons a Wizard Mage to kill the Demon King. Fearing for his life, the Demon King flees to the future. Now it is up to you, the First Samurai, to find and kill the Demon King. The Wizard Mage sends you into the future, armed with the magic sword, to take your revenge (thank goodness there's no kidnapped princess).

This game is a lot of fun to play. It has excellent graphics, with a changing background and every leg of the spiders moving. The music keeps with the eastern style of the game, and the sound effects are good right down to the swish of the sword. All in all this game is worth playing and a fun way to pass the time.

Directions:

First Samurai is a beat-em-up game that is full of non-stop action. Fight through 12 levels to get to the Demon King and avenge your master. You start out in the forest and eventually make your way through to different villages until you get to the dungeon where your foe is hiding.

Keep an eye on the length of your arm in the lower left hand corner, because it tells you how much life you have left.

This game is unique in the way that when you run out of life, your sword disappears and the amount of force you have becomes your life. When your sword disappears, you fight with your fists and your feet. Your sword will return when you have enough force, which you get by defeating enemies. Also, you can get more life by eating food you find along the way. At the end of each level is a boss, such as the Evil Overlord which are two dragons that represent ying and yang, the driver of the Time Train, a Giant Spider, and a large War Computer that spits glowing worms at you.

Don't worry though, it's not just you and your sword, you also pick up sub-weapons along the way, such as knives, axes, and grenades. You also pick up bells, which you use in certain areas to cast spells (the spells are not a choice, the effect is what you need it to be at the time). So good luck, and watch your lives cuz you only have 4. Have fun, Samurai!

THE ADVENTURE BEGINS

On a quest for his lost identity, Conrad Hart must combat alien conspirators and their minions on Earth and on alien worlds. On the way he encounters allies who offer advice and clues so he can complete his mission to save Earth.

--From the SNES Flash Back: The Quest for Identity instruction manual.

Overview:

You are a scientist on the run from aliens. As you are making your escape on a jet bike you are shot down. You wake up on the planet below, your memory is gone, and all you have is a holocube as a clue as to where to go. You must search for who you are and hopefully stop the impending threat.

The graphics may be blocky but believe me the story makes up for it.

Directions:

This game plays a lot like Out of this World. You will solve puzzles both physical and mental to survive each level. Doing errands for people will sometimes reward you with new information or items to help you along the way. Gadgets such as force fields, cartridges, a shield battery, and pistol will serve as tools to solve puzzles.

This game will have you wanting more even after you have beaten it. 

Controls:

A Button - Draw or conceal weapon.
B Button - Use selected inventory item.
X Button - No use.
Y Button - Run, fire weapon, activate objects, climb down ledge, pick up item.

Frank Thomas' Big Hurt Baseball is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Sega Genesis baseball game that was released near the end of the Super NES' timeline. The game features realistic pitching, realistic batting, and features a likeness of Frank Thomas himself. Pitching and batting can be down either in a high, medium, or low direction for greater realism. Various scenarios offer different challenges that take place in either the 20th century or the 21st century; an example of a game scenario would involve playing as the then-Montreal Expos in the World Series that was never meant to be due to the 1994 Major League Baseball strike.

In the darkest depths of space many beings lurk... some are unimaginable creatures of terror... & others just happen to be rather nice (despite being green & spotty!). The Insideos are, however, definitely the former... evil, twisted & purple - their one aim is to conquer all lifeforms who possess more than one leg - for, by a curious twist of fate, the Insideo race have always been monopods. This is the root cause of their insane jealousy - they hate anyone - or anything that possess more than one limb (many planets in the galaxy have been taken over by the snarling Insideo hordes!).

The Insideos learn of the peaceful Fleaworld, where the inhabitants have not only two legs - but four arms... & that, to an Insideo, is simply adding insult to injury! So, on the Insideo home world, the massive DESTRUKTOKON starships are launched - with the Evil Baron Von Spitz at their helm, with a mission to cut the Fleaworld down to size!!

The attack comes quickly - the citizens of Fleaworld are a peaceful bunch - so the Insideo Troopers take very little time in herding the small & helpless fleas into the detention cells, deep in their Destruktokons... all, that is, save one little flea... a flea they happen to call Frantic!

As darkness falls Frantic sneaks into the Insideo ship - the advantage of his tiny size means he can easily avoid the Insideo detection devices. Eventually he reaches the holding pens & manages to set his brothers & sisters free. The newly liberated Minifleas scatter everywhere in blind panic searching the ship in an attempt to reach the exit doors... & freedom!

Meanwhile, inside the bowels of the ship, Frantic stumbles into an empty electronic lab (full of half finished Insideo devices) - as he searches around he stumbles over a massive machine marked 'Enormotron' (the only good habit the Insideos have is the clear labelling of their nefarious devices!). Frantic makes a snap decision - activates the machine & jumps inside. The machine magically increases his size to that of the Insideos... now, not only can he help his friends & even the odds... but kick purple alien butt too!

Publisher: Majesco Games
_________________________

The goal of the game is simple, to safely maneuver 5 frogs across five lanes of busy traffic, a fast moving river, three lanes of treacherous logs, two lanes of swimming turtles, while avoiding snakes, alligators and crocodiles. Sounds easy? You'll need lots of skill, and a bit of luck, as you hop to victory, while trying not to become a highway statistic by leaving your 'mark' on the roadway!

--From the SNES Frogger instruction manual.

Overview:

This game was a great port of the mega classic arcade game, Frogger. The improved graphics and nostalgic game-play made this game one of the best remakes I've ever played. The sounds were wonderful and very low on the annoying factor. Frogger was one of the biggest arcade games ever. There are a whole bunch of websites out there dedicated to Frogger. Then there is a whole other set of sites that are dedicated to classic arcade games where Frogger is one of there main attractions. Frogger has one of the widest and most diverse fan bases. If you like arcade games, and you haven't played or at least heard of Frogger, then I don't see how you can really call yourself a fan of classic arcade games. If you like Frogger or if you've just never played Frogger before, give this redo of a mega classic a try!

Directions:

Get as many frogs as you can across the highway and then across the lake to the safe caves on the other side. 

Controls:

Just use the D-pad to hop in the desired direction. 

Hints:

Extra Points
Be sure to get the female frog as many times as possible to maximize your point score.

Front Mission

Release Year: 2001
Original Title: Front Mission
Translated By: Front Mission Translation Projec
Version: 1.0b
_________________________

People in the scene go wild over many of the things in Japan. J-Pop. Giant Mechas. Strategy RPGs. Well, Front Mission takes two of those three things (guess which ones), and swirls them together. The combination of giant robots with huge-ass guns fighting in a turn-based strategy environment should satisfy the inner fan-boy in all of us. The graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is excellent SRPG fare. So maybe you'll like it more than Spinner 8 did. Probably.

Translation Description:

This translation took a long time and is the fruit of many, many people's labors. Kudos to F.H. and crew for a job well done.

Tips:

Arena Town
Highlight 'New Game', hold L + R, press A + Up.

Change Roid's face
Go to the Status Window in town, hold L + R+Down, press Start to select new face, hold X + Y as well, press B,
release all buttons.

Sound Test
Highlight 'Load Game', hold L + R, press A + Down.

The Ziege Gun
In Mission 15, move to the top left-most corner of the map. You will find a weapon called the 'Ziege Gun', which can either be sold for 15000 Huffmann Dollars, or equipped. It has 1x99 damage, and gives 700 exp. on a miss.

Front Mission: Gun Hazard
Platform: Super NES

Original Title: Front Mission: Gun Hazard
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.01
_________________________
*
Front Mission: Gun Hazard is a sidescrolling action game. And as a sidescrolling action game, it has nothing to do gameplay-wise (or story-wise, debatably) with the other Front Mission games. This is why I actually enjoy Gun Hazard.

Apparently the same team who did Cybernator/Assault Suits Valken did this game, and it's pretty apparent from playing them both. You walk around in your Wanzer and shoot things. And you sometimes punch things. At the start your duty is to protect the President from a coup at the hands of a powerful general, but I'm sure that All Is Not What It Seems, as is usually the case.

Just to remind you that yes, you're playing Front Mission, you're given a wide assortment of equipment you can use to equip your mech however you see fit. It isn't the exhausting overwhelming chore like in the other FM games, though. It seems pretty standard to me. Hey, do you want your normal gun or this shotgun? Stuff like that.

The soundtrack, provided by a variety of Square talent (but mostly the heroes Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda) is excellent. Sometimes I wonder why Uematsu gets all this overwhelming adulation just for composing music for a particularly popular RPG series, but God damn his music rocks. Better recognize!

Translation Description:

Check the readme for known bugs and stuff. Specifically, sometimes when writing text to the screen, the game leaves out a letter. It's really weird, but Gideon Zhi already knows about it and it's not a big deal, I guess.

      A paint program that offers different tools and brushes, a few pre-made backgrounds and objects as well as the option to import figures that were created in the sub-games 'Stylin' Stuff' and 'mix 'n match'.

 - Games:

      Mouse Maze: A Pac-Man-clone in which the player guides a mouse through a top-down labyrinth. To complete a level, all cheese symbol have to be collected while cats have to be avoided. Collecting a bone temporarily transforms the mouse into a dog that can kill the cats.

      Space Lazer: A shooter seen from the cockpit of a space-ship. The player controls a crosshair and has to shoot increasingly difficult enemies.

      Whack a Clown: This game is exclusive to the Genesis Version and plays like 'Whac-a-Mole' only with clowns instead of moles.

 - Music:

      Songs can be composed by choosing from several instruments and putting notes onto a stave. It is also possible to add sound effects (animal noises and others) or edit provided songs.

 - Style:

      This section contains two mini-games:

      Stylin' Stuff: Here, the player can edit the sprite of a woman by selecting different clothes, hats or haircuts.

      mix 'n match: Sprites can be created by putting together different heads, torsi and legs.

Genre: Role Playing Game , Strategy , Turnbased
Release Year: 1992
Developer: Koei
Publisher: Koei
_________________________
*
The game takes place in the fictitious Isle of Ishmeria. Once upon a time, six wizards, each wielding a unique brand of magic, used their powers to protect the island and maintain peace. This was disrupted when they were collectively challenged by a Fire Dragon, summoned forth by a wizard intent on plunging the country into darkness.

The sea-dwelling dragon of peace known as the Pastha charged the six wizards with the task of fighting back. They succeeded, sealing the Fire Dragon away into a ruby at the top of a crown, and themselves became the six jewels around the crown's base. The crown, called Gemfire, was a symbol of utmost power and authority.

When Gemfire fell into the hands of the now current King of Ishmeria, Eselred, he sought to abuse the object's power, using it to embark on a tyrannical reign, instilling fear within his oppressed subjects. Ishmeria fell into despair as his power flourished. Finally, his young daughter, Princess Robyn, could bear to watch her father's grievous misdeeds no longer--she seized Gemfire and pried the six wizard gems loose, causing them to shoot upward into the sky and circle briefly overhead before scattering themselves to different parts of Ishmeria. When a furious Eselred learned of Robyn's actions, he had her locked her away in a tower; but it was futile as the deed had already been done, and Robyn had taken the crucial first step toward freeing her people.

Meanwhile, the six wizards each take up residence with a prominent family of Ishmeria. The two most powerful of these clans are the Blanches, led by Prince Erin and supported by Zendor, Emerald Wizard and Wielder of Lightning; and the Lyles, led by Prince Ander and backed by Pluvius, Sapphire Wizard and Caster of Meteors. Four other clans (Flax, Coryll, Chrysalis and Molbrew) also have wizards of Gemfire at their disposal in the beginning. With the breaking of the spell on Gemfire, each of these clans sets out to unseat Eselred, claim the throne as their own and restore order and peace to Ishmeria.

Gameplay:

At the outset of the game, the player has the option of selecting a scenario and family. The chosen scenario only changes the relative power and territories of the families, although the minor families are only present in one or two scenarios. Ultimately, the player is charged with conquering the entire map.

Gameplay is divided into the main world map screen and individual battle screens. On the map screen, the player is allowed one action per turn (in-game month) per territory. With that action, the player may hire or move troops, upgrade the territory's economy or defenses, engage in diplomatic actions (such as sabotage or plunder a neighboring territory), or attack an adjacent neighboring territory.

Upon attacking or being attacked by an enemy, the focus then shifts to that battle. The player moves individual companies of troops about the map in a turn-based tactics fashion; certain units may build fences to keep enemies out. One army wins if the enemy base is captured, all enemy units are defeated, or the enemy army runs out of food.

The player is given the option to conquer either the country of Mongolia as Genghis Khan himself, or to play as a world leader and take over the known world of the time. Both conquests are made through the balance of economy, population, buying and selling manufactured goods, family relations, promoting and demoting generals, developing military, all in a turn-based fashion. All of these actions can happen only within a given amount of "turn points", so some actions are given priority while others are overlooked. The game also includes a turn-based battle sequence, allowing specific control to the player or delegated to a general.

George Foreman's KO Boxing is a boxing game produced by Acclaim. The games was released in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and other 16-bit gaming consoles such as the Super Nintendo that features retired multiple heavyweight champion and inventor of the Foreman grill, George Foreman. The game was also later available on the 8-bit Sega Master System, and virtually identical Sega Game Gear version, due to the similarity of the hardware architecture.

In the 16-bit versions, the player takes a generic boxer and must go on to defeat other generic boxers in the game in order to take on George Foreman in a 12-round boxing match featuring toe-to-toe action. Instant replays of every knockout provide a realistic pay-per-view look to the action that is going on in the screen. The game uses various camera angles for added realism.

In the 8-bit versions, the player character is George Foreman himself, and "powers up" before each match against increasingly difficult fighters. Unlike the 16-bit versions, the game is only side view action.

Ghoul Patrol is a Super NES video game that is a sequel to Zombies Ate My Neighbors. It was released in September 1994 by LucasArts. The game stars Zeke and Julie, the characters from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

The story follows Zeke and Julie as they must save their town from a horror exhibit come to life. They travel through five worlds (Metropolis, Oriental, Caribbean, Medieval, and Hell) with four levels each, except hell and medieval era, medieval era has only 2 levels and hell only has 1 level.

The game has a host of monsters such as flesh-eating plants, ninja spirits, and ghosts that jump out of garbage cans. There is a wide range of weapons including plasma guns, plunger arrows, squirt guns, and various other tools to defeat your enemies.

While Ghoul Patrol was marketed as a sequel to the beloved "Zombies ate my Neighbors," and though the gameplay, music, and overall style are quite similar, it was actually intended as a completely unrelated game. As "Zombies" designer Mike Ebert explains:

"What happened is they had another game that was kind of lost and struggling, so they changed it into "Ghoul Patrol" and called it a sequel to ZAMN in hopes that it would actually sell. It really never was supposed to have anything to do with Zombies Ate My Neighbors. I was shocked when I first saw it in the test department and the characters looked like the Z.A.M.N characters."

The story of Glory of Heracles 3 consists of the protagonist who wakes up in a village of pixies without even remembering his name. Throughout the game the protagonist (which is named by the player) is continually brought to a dream world while he sleeps.

Along the journey he finds others whom he saw in the dream and searches to reveal his true self and his past. Companions gather along the way and overcome many great tribulations together. Some of these include being swallowed by a giant sea monster, using the great Trojan horse, flying Daedalus' kite, speaking with the divine Lord Zeus, and much much more.

Translation Description:

This is a complete translation of the game. All work on the previous beta patch was scrapped due to game crashing bugs everywhere. The game has been rehacked and even more has been translated (Myth Handbook and Reion's Journal).

Go Go Ackman
Platform: Super NES

Genre: Platformer , Action
Release Year: 1999
Original Title: Go Go Ackman
Translated By: Ackman Translations
Version: 1.0
_________________________

Madness, that is how this game is easily explained. It is a neat platform game where you play Ackman, who harvests souls for Satan. Ackman is able to run around from left to right and obtain different power-ups as he collects souls. How he collects the souls is his little red demon buddy named Bodom. Yet as the main characters of the game, they need to have enemies.

Throughout the game, Ackman must face hordes of angels that are trying to stop him from obtaining souls for Satan. He is challenged and faced by Tenshi, who is his rival counterpart angel. Tenshi helps add a little flavor into the game.

Yet, the humor of the game is amazing. It is filled with extremely funny bits and pieces that will help the player follow the storyline of the game. What really sticks out is the facal expressions of the different characters of the game. Because, they really help set the mood of the game with a nice comical background.

However, the music in the game is ok for it's generation. It's pretty much stereotypical music that sometimes feels out of place in the enviroment of the levels. What really drives my button is the sound in the game.

The sound is annoying. It nearly drives me insane from the start. When Ackman jumps, it makes this sound that really is more confusing than what it should be.

Translation Description:

The translation comes out really good. It's interesting to see the humor being translated into English and still be effective.

The hacking of the script went really well. Some of the sentences that the characters say could've been touched up a little bit better, but it doesn't stop the game flow.

The text used in the game though is what really hurts sometimes. It's really big font. But, it could've been used to make some of the puns in the game hold up the comical laughter.

A city lost in legend

An unconquered warrior seeking reward

A challenge laid down by the Gods

The greatest prize of all - immortality

4 great events combine to bring forth a burning legend

Relive that legend

Who would have thought that a man would be so foolish or so daring as to accept a challenge set down by the Gods? And yet one came forward to claim the right to test his skills and strengths against a city so legendary its name alone struck fear in the hearts of all who heard it spoken.

Firstly, let us talk of this city.

None can be sure that the city even exists for no one has ever seen it. It was build by the Gods, a plaything, great temples, hidden underworlds, fiendish labyrinths and soaring towers. It is a city stolen by the forces of darkness, the abode of nightmare hosts, the dwelling of fearsome monsters, the dominion of four great guardians.

Secondly, who is the hero?

Has anyone matched him in battle? No. Has he ever turned aside from his sole quest? Never. Is he not therefore a hero among heroes? Undoubtedly.

In his travels our warrior has become skilled in all the weapons of war; he is strong and unflinching. What of all the prizes of the world does he seek? He wishes to join those fickle masters of the human race - the Gods themselves.

Thirdly, I shall recount the challenge of the Gods.

Were the Gods only joking when they laid their challenge? Uncaring and unthinking on Mount Olympus, they thought that no one would hear their rash words.

Any man may earn through skill and courage a single favor of the Gods, if he will face the fear of the ancient city and slay the four great guardians who have stolen our citadel from us.

Through their contempt for man did they not bring about their own undoing? For never before had such an untamed reward been offered to the mortals. But who from the ranks of man would face destruction at such odds? Surely none.

Only One.

Finally, what did the hero ask of the Gods.

Immortality breeds contempt and the Gods, so long uncaring for the events of man, know nothing of the exploits of our hero. He stands before them showing neither fear nor disdain and asks the Gods that should he return, fulfilling completely their quest, he will join them as an equal and a brother.

The horror, the impertinence, the mistake realized too late, the gateway lies open to their domain where no mortal man has ever trod before.

But the world of the Gods may not be broken and only the hope of the hero's failure comforts them as the warrior departs for the City of Legends, preparing to carve one more story on its walls...

Awesome AWESOME game. At first glance you may just think "damn, this is just another Final Fight clone" cause, you know, there were tons of them back then. Don't worry though, this one's cool. First of all, the humor's pretty apparent throughout the game. And mostly food-related. You can pick between a narcissistic body-builder, a hot and sexy Chun Li lookalike, and, uhh, some weird guy with spikes. You have a button for punching, a button for jumping, and a separate button for posing. How can you not love this game?

Translation Description:

Well, most of the in-game stuff is done, like enemies and ingredients, but the story stuff and character bios aren't. Sorry. It's not like the plot's gonna be interesting anyways. Play the game. There's Moai heads. They sneeze.

Oh, and contrary to the readme, the version number is 0.80. See, this is what happens when you reuse readmes from other translations!

GP-1

Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Racing
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Atlus

_________________________

Get on your bike and drive off into excitement. GP-1 is a high speed motorcycle racing game that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and leaning with the bike on the screen. Get on, start up, and take off, are all you need to know to play this game. What's the point of this game, you may ask. The answer is simple, finish the race before anyone and be the best. Have fun, gamer, and start your engines.

GP-1 is a fun high-speed racing game with graphics that were very good for SNES, right down to the skid marks when you take off, and music that will keep your heart pumping. This game is very fun and competitive. So mount up and let the road take you.

Directions:

GP-1 is a high speed racing game that will take you all around the world from America to Japan. Play by yourself or go head to head with a friend and see which one of you is the best. 

Choose Practice mode to improve your time by getting a feel for the many courses and the nine bikes that you can chose from (although the only difference between the bikes is the color). Play Grand Prix (one player mode) to go all around the world and become the best of the best. If you have a friend over, chose 1P vs 2P to see which one of you is the better bike rider. Now down to game play.

The gameplay of this game is pretty simple: forward and back have been disabled, because all you really need is right and left. If you want to go faster, hit the gas, and if you want to stop, hit the brake. Can't get much easier than that. I highly recommend this game for the racing fan. So sit down, log in, and have fun. 

Controls:

A Button - ACCELERATE
B Button - BRAKE
X Button - ACCELERATE
Y Button - NOTHING
Start Button - PAUSE / RETIRE
Select Button - NOTHING

GP-1 is back in this high speed sequel that makes the first GP-1 look like kiddy racing. GP-1 has never been like this before, with better bikes and more challenging courses. But don't take my word for it, let the game speak for itself. This game will have you leaning forward in your chair and left and right with the bike as if you were really riding it. So mount up, turn the key, and burn some rubber.

GP-1 part 2 leaves its predecessor in the dust when it comes to graphics, with more realistic bikes and roads, and even the real-looking speedometer in the corner of the screen. The music in this game is even more high-paced and heart-pounding than the first GP-1. This game is highly recommended and very fun.

Directions:

GP-1 part 2 is a high speed racing game that plays much like the original GP-1. There are three modes to chose from: Grand Prix lets you race the computer all over the world and see who is the best of the best. Time Attack is just like the Practice mode of the original game, chose your track and your bike and ride around the track alone to record your time. Also, just like the original, you can go head to head with a friend. In this, however, it gets more in-depth with the bikes. Rather then just being a different color, this game has bikes that are different as far as horse power, handling, and acceleration that you can choose from, so that now you can pick a bike that suits your own style of racing.

The tracks range from all around the world, from America to Brazil and even as far as Japan. Forward and Back are still disabled because all you need is right and left. Go faster by hitting the gas and stop by hitting the brake, it's just that simple. Start your engines, boys, and get ready for some high speed racing. So sit down, log in, and have fun.

A Button - ACCELERATE
B Button - BRAKE

_________________________

FROM WHENCE IT CAME

In the darkest quadrant of space there churns the vortex of Bad Vibes. Bacterion, it has been called, is a malignant mass that has spawned all that is wicked in the universe. Feeding on the suffering of the innocent, it moves like a germ throughout the galaxy, manifesting itself in unspeakably hideous forms. In the past, Bacterion has only had the power to rear its ugly head on a few isolated occasions. That is, until now.

Being a good Gradian, your history class in primary school was the first place you heard of the ancient Heroic Missions to fight Bacterion. You even got a toy Warp Rattler for your fifth birthday. Those were the days when it was just a chapter in your history book.

History is important to the people of Gradius, as is all the higher pursuits of knowledge, art and music. Gradius has reached a renaissance. Your people are known all throughout the universe as a good and pace loving nation. Who would have known that it would come down to this.

The ancient scholars prophesied that a day would come when the Evil Beast would be unleased after eons of being kept at bay, inflicting a slow and painful death on the entire galaxy. That day has come.

After a heart wrenching journey through the Gradian Desert Lands, you have come to terms with your fate. It is your mission to save all that is good in the universe. You must defeat the diabolical entities that plague Gradius and the surrounding planets. Fare thee well, brave warrior.

--From the SNES Gradius 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

Are you ready for some out-of-this-world action? Then play Gradius III! This game is like most scrolling space shooters: fly through the galaxy and shoot the enemy ships. Good luck! You're the galaxy's last hope.

I might have expected a little more than what's offered in the game, but this is an early SNES game. Good work Konami for making this quality game!

Directions:

Your goal is to complete several action-packed levels by shooting the enemies that come towards you and use the powerups that lay around the levels. Before you start, you can choose from a preconfigured list of powerups or select your own in Edit mode. After that, you can start showing the enemies who's boss. In the levels, you can grab a pod with an orange center to go up through the powerup selection. Blue pods destroy all enemies on the screen. Be prepared as they get smarter as you pass the levels. The only flaw is that the two-player mode is alternating. 

Controls:

A Button - Use powerup, confirm
B Button - Fire, cancel
Start Button - Pause, confirm
Select Button - Select from menu

Tips:

30 Extra Ships
At the title screen, hold L and press A, A, A, Start 

Arcade Mode
In the Options menu, highlight the Game Level, and rapidly tap the A BUTTON until the level turns into ARCADE. 

Extra Credits
At the title screen, press the X button as many times as you can and then press start before the screen fades out.

Full Power-Up
Pause the game and press Up, Up, Down, Down, L, R, L, R, B, A 

Random Weapon Select
At the weapon select screen, press Right on the D-pad to enter Edit Mode. Then press X, Y, X, X, Y, Y, X, Y 

Suicide
Pause the game and press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start. 

System Reset
Hold L + R and Start, then press Select. 

Bonus Stage
There is a bonus stage located in the game.  It is located in Level 2. When you fly into the section that is lined with the blue bubbles, look for a hole in the bottom and go in it.

Bonus stages
There are five bonus stages in the game. Here is how to access each one:

Stage 2-When you see a hole in the wall at the bottom of the screen, fly down there.
Prerequisite: None

Stage 3-When you reach the lower level of the stage, there is a platform in the ceiling that drops down.  When it drops down, fly just below the part where the platform was.
Prerequisite: Destroy all of the ground targets in thestage up to that point.

Stage 4-In the last set of Moai heads (they look like Easter Island heads), there is one laying down which will lift itself up. Fly behind it.
Prerequisite: Nothing must be highlighted on your powerup bar.

Stage 5-Fly just below the ceiling before the narrow corridor.
Prerequisite: The hundreds digit of your score reads 5, 7, or 3.

Stage 7-Just after the long downward slope in the second half of the level, stay close to the ground and fly into the wall formation shaped like this:

[CHART REMOVED]

(key: dots are empty space, lines are walls, the asterisk is there your ship should be.).
Prerequisite: Unknown

When you clear a bonus stage, you will end up in the next level. That's right, you don't have to fight the boss of the level you were in previously. However, if you get killed in the bonus stage, you will be taken back to the regular level, and will not be able to reenter the bonus stage.

Easy Final Boss
The Final Boss, Bacterion, will die regardless of whether you attack it or not. Just dodge his blasts, and in fifteen or so seconds, he will spontaneously die. Even cheaper, park your ship in the bottom center of the screen, and the shots can't aim towards you!

Extended Demo Mode
Continue to hold A through the initial demo, and you'll see the entire first stage including the boss.

Full Power Up w/o using the code
Choose 'speed down' for the '!' option in the weapon select screen, if you can get enough power ups to highlight the last weapon, which will not be visible, and using it without powering up on speed up, you will get all four options, missiles, and the shield. But if you have the laser already, it will be taken away.

Spread the Options
Activate the R-Option and collect enough power-ups so that the option selection is highlighted. Now press and hold the A button.

Original Title: Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy
Translated By: Stealth Translations
Version: 0.99
_________________________

Okay, where to begin? Well, in Gulliver Boy, you play as Gulliver. He gets this really nifty energy-wave-hadouken thing which is his main attack, and you eventually get spiffy Minder attacks which are basically like spells and stuff. And you also get this Edison guy who really has very limited use 'cuz he only gets one or two bombs (at first) and he takes forever to make more. The game is also rather short (I completed it in about six hours, I think.)

The story in short: Spain is trying to take over Europe, and Judo, prince of Spain or something, killed Gulliver's father. Now Gulliver's pissed off and wants revenge. Who wouldn't? And so you set off to kick ass with nothing but Edison's bombs, Gulliver's hadouken thing, and Gulliver's gigantic hair. Misty eventually joins you, but ends up being dead weight at first :P Oh, and in the second part of the game, you get this badass mech thing for all of two or three boss battles.

Translation Description:

All around, the translation kicks ass and the game kicks ass, even if it is really short. Ah well? It's still worth the six-to-eight hours of your time it takes to beat it :)

The text doesn't display on BSNES, so it's probably safe to assume that the patch won't work on a real SNES.

Okay. Normally, I'm not the biggest fighting game fan in the world. I usually stick to my Capcom and my SNK and wave my middle fingers at the crappy knock-offs that other companies try to throw at me. Having said that, I was shocked to find that this game is not only pretty good, it's great. Bandai usually churns out ho-hum games based on anime licenses, but this is an exception. I mean, yeah, it's still an anime license, but it's not ho-hum. The graphics are very pretty, the music is rockin, and the gameplay mechanics are smooth as you could want them to be. If you're bored with Super Duper Ultimate Mecha World Champion Street Fighter 2 Omega3, give this a shot.

Translation Description:

Well, there wasn't much to do, besides menus, post-fight banter and intro/ending text, and of course having been a project of THE ZHI, all that stuff is done. Play this game without fear of random Japanese phrases!

Tips:

Play as Epyon
To play as Epyon, only in Trial or VS. mode, highlight Tallgeese and press L, L, L, L, R, R, R, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R

Use Super Moves in mid-air (Specific Units) glitch
This glitch applies for the following Units: HEAVYARMS, SANDROCK, WINGZERO, MERCURIOUS, and TALLGEESE. Normally, these Units cannot perform any super moves in the air or while jumping. This can be bypassed, however, by jumping and then inputting the command for the super (Usually: down, down-forward, forward x2) plus BOOSTER (any two attack buttons simultaneously except Buttons L and R) instead of pressing just one button! The Unit will perform the super but still be in the 'standing-on-solid-ground' animation!

"Gunforce: Badly Executed Terribly by Igen"

Back Story
Back in the day, Contra and its sequels, were king. Perhaps not the first 2d shooters, but definitely the genre- defining ones. Why so? Basically they were badass- so badass that Maddox has a whole article donated to the badassery that was Contra III, but moving on. Doubtlessly, thousands of 3rd party developers looked at them and said "hey, the programming language is easy, the gameplay just needs to be rehashed along with everything else and we can make ourselves some quick bucks from our overcramped basement office". Enter Gunforce.

Fact was however, they failed. Pretty much all of them, who knows why, mabye copywright infringement on gameplay or something. Gunforce is such a title that falls here. If you get anything out of this review let it be this: Gunforce is rushed, unoriginal, ugly and sometimes laughably poor. Out of all of the 2d shooters, Gunforce is somewhere at the bottom. Don't get me wrong, it actually has one or two mediocre moments, but it's shockingly bad.

Graphics
Backgrounds are quite colourful at least, reminscent of Street Fighter I, or mabye even Jurassic Park II on the SNES had there been some more sprites to play with. It ends drastically there however, as all characters are horrifically executed. Your character has 2 frames of animation for running, 2 for climbing (which could damage your retinas if you concentrated on it for too long) pop in one for crouching and get this- perhaps the ugliest, unintentionally phallic illustrations of aiming the gun diagonally down or up. Bullets arn't pretty, and the enemies are copies of you in different colours basically. Explosions are also lacklustre, kinda cartoony as well. This guide doesn't have the space for describing the various vechicles you get though. While one or two, such as the armed mine cart is somewhat acceptable, the helicopter and jeep are shockingly bad. The jeeps wheels bounce along as if they are out of a DuckTales comic (VERY disturbing from an otherwise serious-ish game). The helicopter cannot be fully seen, as it plods its great mass across the screen, making the already weak gameplay even worse. Like everything else in this game, poorly executed, with 1 or 2 nice touches that are made redundant by everything else. Terrible intro screen.

Sound
Some things are ok here, the bullets have a reasonably meaty feel to them. The Green Laser sound is suitable here too. However enemies are soundless, and the background music is insanely digitized. One point worth mentioning is the scream from your character when he dies, I can't work out if it's quite decently done complete with heart wrenching agony, or it sounds like tearing velco while stepping on your cat. Considering the rest of the game, I'm going for the latter.

Gameplay
Controls are sluggish for a game such as this. Bullets may or may not hit you, same goes for enemies, which sometimes jump (without any inclination of a frame of animation for it). Gun on vechicles would be ok, where it not for their disability to shoot beyond the normal 8 points (enemies on turrents have the same disability). Jumping is hazardous owing to the characters remarkable ability to float a little with even less control. Bosses are the ugliest, most unoriginal things I have ever seen anywhere, let alone a video game trying to break into a market. Some things are admittadly nice, the shooting is responsive and killing a few guys and getting past a couple of levels is rewarding with the little man for some odd reason saying "I have smashed the front base... ... I will now go for enemy weapon making." or something equally banal. His word choice does not change for any, apart from what he crushed and what he is about to crush, but again, another nice touch poorly executed yet something not even Contra III can lay claim to (although it's badassery makes up for it an infinite amount). What gets rid of any plus though is the moving platforms on level 3- over bottomless pits, your hero may or may not jump on these things, for essentially the whole level making it near unplayable. It's not frustrating, just bad. Admittadly quite amusing for a while.

Conclusion
Despite all of its faults, I find myself picking this up sometimes when I'm bored. Mabye it's a sadomasochistic fantasy I'm not aware of, or perhaps it reminds me of an era which video games were video games and character develop was unheard of. In a few years time, they'll look back on this as a C-grade game... of a NES if they don't have enough information, because really that is what it is. If you see it poking around in an old games shop or something I actually suggest you buy it for comedy value and who knows, you may gleam a half hour of mindless fun from perhaps one of the worst games on record.

Imagine Link to the Past, with all the puzzles taken out, and instead you're given a bow with infinite arrows. Oh, and all the enemies shoot at you. Now you have Gunman's Proof. You're a boy in the Old West who willingly becomes possessed by an alien sheriff with the intention of capturing the evil Demi, another alien who probably did some unspeakable atrocities. You live in the only town, in the center of the island, and go through a bunch of sequential dungeons before going through the last dungeon and, I assume, taking Demi down. Pow! There's some nice additions to the gameplay, like being able to duck under the bullets that are being shot at you, and, uh, shooting diagonally and stuff. Okay, maybe, just maybe this game kinda rubbed me the wrong way. Either that or I got pissed cause I can't beat the first dungeon boss. I suck so much.

...Anyways, this is, like everyone else will tell you, a Zelda game with a heavy emphasis on action and almost nothing to speak of concerning puzzles or thinking. And the music totally kicks ass.

Translation Description:

This is one of the few translated scripts to have been graced by the editing hand of Shih Tzu, and the end result is absolutely gorgeous. Regardless of your feelings towards the game itself, the translation is nothing short if remarkable. Oh, Gideon Zhi and Zackman did a good job too. Definitely.

Anyways, the translation is complete and you should have no problems with playing it. Kay?

"Wrestling Purists Only"

Hammerlock is a good wrestling game for those you who like the All Japan wrestling show, it is very much All Japan-esque. You have characters straight out of Japan that are sampled from real life wrestlers. The Great Muta, Stan Hansen(Baron Kaiser), The Great Tenryu, Hulk Hogan, and Vader(Alpha Bosak) are characters sampled in this game. It has a wide variety of slams & suplexes for the wrestling purists. A handful of dirty tactics such as a foreign object to the face behind the ref's back made their way into this game. It's hard to find this game, it's from Jaleco(The people who produced NES' Bases Loaded). The game features many different ways to play, it's the first game to feature the Round Robin tournament system. There are several bloated wrestlers in this game who appear to be sumo wrestlers. The game play is slow, every time you hit a move your wrestlers takes a brief nap on the mat. The graphics are good, the game appears much like a comic book would.

The sound is decent, the crowd gets into the match if you hit a lot of moves, but it gets pretty quiet when you're not locking up or exchanging punches. Each wrestler has his own personalized theme music though. No wild brawling, beer bottles, or such. All the cheating and brawling in this game is done inside the ring. It's a very hard to find title for SNES like I said, I recommend it for wrestling purists that own the SNES. It handles like Super Fire Pro does for the Famicom. The game is a goodie, I like it because of all the different suplexes, martial art kicks, and a slew of submission holds. There is even a small dose of areal moves such as moonsaults, and leg drops from the top rope. I don't recommend this game to people who can't handle a game where your man falls to the ground after every move he hits except for the body slam. Patience is the key to Hammerlock wrestling.

Harvest Moon
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1997
Developer: Pack-In-Video
Publisher: Natsume
_________________________
*
The game play consists of daily tasks, and strategically using your time wisely for the best outcome in the end. For vegetables to develop, they must receive water each day; lack of water does not kill crops, but does keep them from growing. Animals must be fed once a day to keep producing. While the only care that chickens require is feeding, cows must be continually talked to, brushed, and milked to retain their health. A cow may become sick and even die if not fed for a day. The only way a chicken can die is to be left outside and allowed to be blown away in a storm or eaten by wild wolves. After dark, the only business in town that the player can access is the bar, where a number of non-player characters gather to drink and talk.

Localization:

In the version of the game released in America, all references to alcohol are changed to "juice," even though anyone who drinks said "juice" clearly becomes intoxicated. (a similar type of censorship practice can be seen in Nintendo of America-published games) While many elements of the game were "westernized" for its American release, some Japanese references were overlooked. For example, townspeople sometimes discuss the church and its religion in Shinto terms, such as referring to the existence of both a "God of the Harvest" and a "God of Business." In several "New Day" cinematics, the character eats an onigiri, a food not familiar to many outside of Japan. The news anchor on TV in the game bows to the audience in a welcoming manner. This is uncommon in western countries.

Reception:

With the exception of HonestGamers, who gave 'Harvest Moon' a 3/10, the game received mainly positive reviews and has a Gamerankings standing of 66.9%.

For the release of Harvest Moon on the Wii's Virtual Console, IGN rated the game at 8.5, praising the game's still gorgeous 16-bit graphics and addictive gameplay.

Tips:

View Your Current Ending Sequence
Hold R + L + Start + Select immediately after the lights go out when done writing in the diary. You must hold down the buttons the entire time. Eventually you will see the ending sequence that would be given to you if the game ended at your current level of progress.

Unlockables

Clock 
Get the first house extension before the first Summer ends

Money Tree 
Have over 20000G and buy it from the Hawker in the fall

Magic Bean 
Sell a cow; if the hawker comes and offers a bean  in exchange for the cow, accept his offer

Wascaly Wabbit = 1000G 
At some point in the game, you can randomly find a rabbit on the mountain. If you run up to it and press A, you catch it. Then the hunter runs up and offers you 1000G to let it go.

Clear the field on the first day and keep the clock at 6 AM
After you start a new game and have gone through the very long introduction of meeting everybody and have
gone to sleep, head out of your farm the next morning. Once you name your dog don't head for the tool shed. Instead just grab the weeds and toss them and grab the small rocks and throw them in the water. Doing so makes time freeze at 6 AM. If you were to head into a building or to use a tool the time will start moving.

Hiouden: Legend of the Scarlet King - The Demonic Oath
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game , Strategy , Fantasy
Release Year: 2005
Original Title: Hiouden: Mamono Tachi to no Chikai
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.00
_________________________
*
Hiouden is a quirky title from many of the developers who went on to make games like Tenshi no Uta, Tales of Phantasia, the Star Ocean series and Valkyrie Profile. You play a crown prince who has fled from his castle under attack, and begin to employ monsters to help you.

It's a point and click strategy RPG, and for an SNES game is very PC-like. (You can even make windows so you can follow the action easier when you split your party up.) The PC-like implementation does suffer a bit from the SNES' small display, but the graphics don't look too rough and the intro is quite pretty. If you're a Motoi Sakuraba fan, you'll love the sound; if not, you might find it a bit dull.

If you can handle the quirkiness, you've got a neat SRPG on your hands.

Translation Description:

The translation's complete, so get cracking! And read the readme, the patch isn't perfect and the game still has some bugs (which were already in the untranslated game).

Hit the Ice
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Hockey
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Taito
Publisher: Taito
_________________________
*
Hit the Ice is said to be the hockey version of Midway's Arch Rivals.

The game is unique because instead of having six players per team (like Konami's Blades of Steel), this game only has three (forward, defense, and goalie). Instead of being normal sized, the players look more like football players and have an older look to them.

Gameplay:

Hit the Ice is based on the game of ice hockey, the aim of the game being to outscore your opponent by shooting the puck into the opponent's net more often than your opponent over three periods of play.

Since the game is "the hockey version of Arch Rivals", however, there are very few rules. Players have special moves, most of which are illegal moves in actual ice hockey (such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, or kicking opponents in the groin). Fights are common, though a player losing a fight is not penalized. Instead, he becomes sluggish for a short period. If the player loses several fights in one period, he leaves the game with an injury.

Every player is capable of a "super shot", which must be charged beforehand. If allowed to charge and shoot, the shot will hit the goaltender with such force that he is knocked back into the net along with the puck, counting as a goal. If a team is far enough behind, his team may receive a power-up in the form of a "super drink", making the stick of the player who consumes it flash with energy and turning every shot into a super shot for a short time.

"This game doesn't know who to appeal to"

I tried out Hungry Dinosaurs (JP: Harapeko Bakka) on a whim, since I had no clue exactly what it was. It turned out to be a simply-designed puzzle game, a kind of game which really isn't seen much anymore. This game isn't as good as some others of this genre, however, mainly because it tries to cater to younger audiences and more mature audiences, and fails on both counts.

There's no story to speak of, as far as I can tell. However, games like this didn't thrive on even a semblance of a story, so this isn't a big problem. As for the play, it's straightforward. Single-player mode pits one player against the computer. The characters are essentially Yoshi rip-offs with more teeth. Play takes place on a 10 x 10 grid. As one of the dinosaurs, you have to lay down as many eggs as you possibly can. By some strange feat of genetic engineering which proves that dinosaurs are smarter than humans, you can change the parent of the eggs (the color, if you don't follow) by having a row, column, or diagonal of eggs encompassed by two eggs of your color. Example: R is Red's eggs, G is Green's eggs. If the laid-down row looks like (RRRRRRG), if you place a G on the opposite end of the row of the placed G (GRRRRRRG), you turn the entire row to G (GGGGGGGG). The object is, by the end of the time period (about 40 seconds), to have the most eggs of your color laid down on the grid.

There are problems with this game. The visuals appear to be made more for younger players; more mature gamers might be turned away by their simplicity. So, it's a game that appeals to younger players, then? Not quite. Even on the easiest difficulty, the game is impressively hard. The AI performs very well, and often times you will lose despite trying your best. You can find strategies to use, but they change with every stage, and take a lot of time to figure out. This is something that the younger of our generations do not fare so well at, if my own observations are any indication. This means that the game caters to an indistinct audience, and that doesn't make it overly appealing.

The multiplayer function confuses me. I haven't played the multiplayer, not having anyone to help me try it out, but they offer a range of two to four players. That's a mean feat on a console with only two controller slots, and I've never heard of an SNES accessory that adds the number of possible players (though there's probably one out there). They do offer hat appears to be a sort of tag-team play, but I don't get that either.

I suppose, if one could get past the kiddy graphics and focus mainly on the puzzle aspect of the game, they would enjoy the challenge. That's a lot to ask for for many people, though, and with other puzzle games that are more fun to play, like Yoshi's Cookie or Tetris, this one will fall by the wayside.

"Standard platform game based on a horrible cartoon."

Why would a game company want to make a game based on such and unknown cartoon?, I don't know, but U.S Gold did it, and one day a friend of mine bring this game to my home, we played, and this is my opinion about it.

As I said before this game is based on a cartoon, I remember having seen some chapters, it is about a soccer team that.... I can't remember, but it was an incredibly mediocre series, because I wasn't interested on it even when I was like ten years old, and if a ten years old child cannot enjoy a cartoon that much, that sure means the show was mediocre, because at the age of ten kinds love more or less anything they are showed, so there is no point on talking about it, just know that it is based on it.

The plot in the game is about a fat guy that challenges the Hurricanes to a charity match on an island whose name I can't remember, the winner will be the best team in the world, but of course the Hurricanes have to reach that island, and that mean fat guy will try to stop them.

Gameplay:
Extremely simple, just run and get rid of the enemies by shooting your soccer ball, and don't worry about the ball, because it will immediately come back to your feet like if it were a boomerang. However, we have to be a little bit careful when we shoot, because sharp objects will make it explode, unless we obtain items to turn the ball into an iron sphere, and tings like that.

The stages are like a little bit out of place, why in the world would a soccer team be passing through a desert full of snakes and scorpions with their soccer ball?, oh I remember, to reach that island the fat guy was talking about.... well, the game is kind of stupid as you can see, but just wait till you see a referee in the middle of the desert showing his red card to you. Anyway, the gameplay is pretty good, a little annoyance is that we shoot our ball further depending on how much we press the attack button, and normally everyone tries to press the button quickly a lot of times, but that way our attack range is very short and the enemies are going to hurt easily, specially the ones that can resist more than one hit, but that it is a minor flaw really, the only thing that can be considered a flaw is that there is nothing really interesting in the whole game, everything the game has to offer has already been done a million of times, this is a standard platform game among the standard platform games.

Graphics:
Nothing outstanding but well done, the backgrounds are specially well made, but aside from that everything very standard, good, but standard.

Music:
Probably there are some tunes from the show, at least during the intro or the menu, but if there is any, I can't remember. The soundtrack is average, but again, not bad.

As a result:
Hurricanes is a good platform game, having to get rid of the enemies shooting our soccer ball everywhere is nice and it is good that the guys from U.S Gold didn't thought about some weird way of using the ball, they just did a nice platform game, fans of the genre are going to enjoy it, there is nothing really interesting about this title, it is just another one without any interest, well made, but just another one.

_________________________

Hyper V-Ball is a Super NES volleyball game and the fourth game of Super Volley series. The player can use either human or robotic volleyball players. While the human players give the game more realism, the robot players can provide special moves that can guarantee points to the player or CPU opponent that can pull them off successfully. This game was featured in the "sports game section" of an old Nintendo Power magazine where the producer of the game McO'River was humorously confused for a new trout burger at McDonald's. The song is by Panamanian artists Rodney Clark and Andy De La Cruz. Clark is known as "El Chombo"

The Power Force is widely credited as the best team in the game, whereas the Turbo Force is the least liked team in the game (this is possibly because of the disliked player, Gas, on the Turbo Force).

HyperZone plays like a cross between a racing game and shooter. The object of the game is to navigate each level while shooting enemies and earning points, until finally an encounter with a boss ends each level. After enough points are acquired, the player earns an "extend" and his or her ship is upgraded in the next stage. The player's ship can receive up to six upgrades.

As a racing game, the resemblance is visual. The mode 7 "tracks" bear a resemblance to the well-known progenitor of mode 7 racing, F-Zero. As a rail shooter, in the same vein as Star Fox, the player's ship is constantly pushed forward through each level. While it is possible to slow down, doing so eventually causes damage to the player's ship.

HyperZone contains eight levels in total. After the initial game is finished, it restarts from the beginning with the player continuing in the same ship and keeping score; the game loops infinitely.

Development & Reception:

HyperZone bears a striking resemblance to Eliminator, a game released for the Amiga and various 8-Bit computers. The game's perspective and its unusual landscapes were inspired by the "Star Gate" sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The offtrack landscape in the Material Factory (Area 1 in the US/European version, Area 3 in the Japanese version) is a tessellation of flashing tetrominos that resemble those in Tetris; the boss in Area 3 resembles the right part of the SNES controller, and buttonsof the same four colors as the Super Famicom logocircle around it. Another HAL game, Kirby's Dream Land 3, references this game: the final area in the game is called Hyperzone, and several other areas share names.

The authors of Video Game Bible: 1985-2002 praised the game's "impressive graphics and level design" and called it a cross between Space Harrier and F-Zero, but criticized its short length and "shallow" gameplay.

Tips:

Level Select
At the title screen press B, B, L, R, Left, Left, Select. Now you can push up to change levels.

Sound Test
At the title screen, hold both L and R together. Select music or sound by pressing Right or Left on the d-pad,
then hitting A. 

Unlockable ships
After you accumulate a certain amount of points in this game, you will gain a new ship (which you will pilot after the level switches). You will also gain one stock (life) along with the ship (after you have got all the upgrades, you will no longer gain any stock).

THE COMET OF AGES

In a civilization so ancient that nothing of it remains today, the first great flowering of human knowledge produced remarkable breakthroughs in the sciences of biology and genetics. These nameless ancients used their knowledge to create new forms of plants and animals that would make life better on earth. Inevitably, some people twisted the science and molded violent beasts of war with hideous intelligence. The monsters terrorized the people and the civilization began to crumble.

In the end, two forces fought over the earth, the Knights of Light and Darkness. The ultimate weapon used in that war was a comet that blazed with radiation and a strange light. The coming of the comet destroyed that race and mutated many people and animals into evil forms, which then hid in the deepest recesses of the world. In the ages that followed, from the time of the Egyptians and Babylonians to the Incas, the comet continued to return every 800 years. And with the return of this Chaos Comet came times of darkness, destruction and disease. Fragmented legends of the comet's effects and clues about its origin were passed down to the civilizations that followed. But as those nations rose then fell and time turned their works to dust, only a few treasures remained hidden in the most ancient ruins of the world.

Our story begins in the age of exploration, a time of great discoveries when brave explorers drew back the dark shrouds of fable and shed light on the ancient wonders. In that time, a party of adventurers from the seaside town of South Cape set off to unlock one of the greatest of mysteries--the legendary Tower of Babel. Olman, the leader, led his fellow townsmen and even his son, Will, into the tower. But then something happened and the expedition was lost without a trace...except for one. Unfortunately, young Will couldn't remember what had happened, how he had been saved, or even how he had managed to return home after his ordeal. Even stranger was the fact that Will now possessed the power to move objects through thought alone.

The Illusion of Gaia follows Will and his companions as they seek the answers to the lost expedition. As they begin their journey, they don't suspect that it will eventually lead them around the globe or that the fate of the planet lies in their inexperienced hands. They'll have to learn and grow and mold their characters into the stuff of heroes as they face the monsters created by the comet in past ages. Not all of the friends complete the journey. Some may turn aside to discover new destinies. And along the way, help may arrive from unexpected quarters--from Gaia, the spirit of the earth, and Freedan, a powerful knight, and from the mysterious Shadow. But Will must go the entire distance, fighting every battle and returning to the Tower of Babel where he must attempt to end the plague of the comet and to find out what happened to his father. And where Will goes, you go as well.

--From the SNES Illusion of Gaia instruction manual.

Overview:

Will, the son of a famous explorer, lives without a father. His father was lost at the Tower of Babel, but Will amazingly made it back alive. However, his memory is vague about what happened. So, with that, he decides to take a journey to the Tower, to find his father. Accompanied with friends, this will be one adventure not to miss!

If I could sum up this game in two words, it would be "highly underrated". Enix made this game, but didn't do much to catch the eye of the beholder. Heh, suckers. Anyway, everything in this game seems flawless. The gameplay is somewhat like classic Zelda, where you hack and slash enemies. The sound and music is superb, each play most unique with a musical score. The graphics are well done, fairly detailed. This game can keep you going for a while. Highly recommended!

Directions:

This game plays much like Zelda. You go through several dungeons, collecting keys, and hacking and slashing at enemies. But there's definitely more to it than that... 

Your life bar is your HP. If you lose all your HP, you die. However, Renews, or extra lives, can be gained. If you collect 100 Dark Gems, which are dropped by enemies, you get one Renew. A Renew is used when you die and you start back at the last door or entrance you were at.

Will is quite different from other heroes in the fact that you're able to change forms. And it's quite easy, too. When in dungeons, you may be able to change into one of two forms: Freedan, an ancient knight, and Shadow, a shapeshifter. Freedan has a long sword, which can attack enemies farther away and his strength is superior to Will's. Shadow can liquefy himself, and get through small cracks in the floor or walls. Both forms will serve you well. As well, Dark Spaces, which are portals, are quite important. If you step inside one, you can save your in-game progress.

If you're low on energy, Herbs can be used. However, use them wisely! They can only be used once each! With Will's flute, new songs can be gained when you go further into the game, and they will prove valuable on your quest. 

Controls:

A Button - Attack, Talk
B Button - Use selected item
L Button - Use Telekenesis, Block (Long Range)
R Button - Same as L
Start Button - Pause Game, Show Map
Select Button - Show Menu

Hints:

Secret Dungeon

If you collect all 50 Red Jewels in the game, you gain access to a secret dungeon, and you can even battle an enemy from Soul Blazer!

Tips:

Unlocking Gem's Secret Mansion
To unlock a secret stage in the game, collect all 50 Red Jewels throughout the game, then visit Gem The Jeweler in the Village Of Dao. He will see you have 50 Red Jewels and will automatically take you to his place (The Secret Mansion).

Native Village save point
The strategy guide states that when in the native village one must go back to Euro to save the game. A closer save point is located in the Native Village. It is in the upper right corner of the village in an alley beside a hut.

The game takes place In the year 2027 AD, where an almost human-like enemy force primarily based in space and primarily using mech technology invades Earth and is in the process of conquering them when the ultimate weapon is produced on Earth's side called Imperium, a small, single pilot mech.

Gameplay:

Imperium differs from most shooters in many ways. For one, the players are controlling a mech rather than a space ship (despite it handling the same as a space ship).

There is no high score counter, but instead an experience points counter. Players earn experience points by destroying multitudes of enemies and the numbers differ depending on the size of the enemy. Players then earn additional weapons and power-ups for each weapon through a set number of experience points.

The player has a five-hit life bar. If a player takes a hit, then whatever weapon they were using when they were hit is down graded by one point. Players can replenish health and any downgraded weapon by earning back experience points. The player also has a speed-change which they can change the speed of their mech to five different levels.

The player has no lives. If the player dies, then it's Game Over. However, they can start on the level they died on by a Continue option that shows up on the main menu after dying. The player however only has four continues.

"A waste of a cool title"

The fantasy genre comes with certain stereotypes. You have your brawny warriors, your gentle female healers, and your physically weak wizards. By titling a game Incantation, then, certain things are expected. I expect to see an enigmatic wizard main character who will use a variety of impressive spells against his enemies; perhaps levitate or summon some animal familiars?sprout magic missiles from his fingertips?that kind of thing. Yet Incantation doesn't deliver. Should it therefore be commended for having the courage to go against convention? Well?.no. The game kinda sucks.

The hero of the story is indeed a wizard. A short, rather pot-bellied boy-wizard who looks like a grade-school bully uncomfortably decked out in robes for Hallowe'en. The wizard carries a hefty bed-post, I mean wand, for a weapon, and when he isn't moving he smacks it in the palm of his hand as if he's about to administer a beating with it. But at least he doesn't go as far as to bean people over the head with the wand. There are actually some colored blobs that shoot out of the wand, and can evolve to more effective blobs as power-ups are collected. This is the extent to which "magic" is used in Incantation. The wand acts like any other generic projectile weapon in the hundreds of other mediocre platformers, and there is very little to distinguish Incantation from any of them.

It is only the quality of the game's graphics that reflect a release date so late in the Super Nintendo's lifespan (1996). The character sprites are colourful and interesting, though ultimately repetitive due to a tendency later in the game toward palette-swapping. The level backgrounds of mountains, forests, caves and marshes are well-rendered and even contain some neat effects like falling rain during the levels (without any slowdown either, it should be noted.)

But aside from the graphics, every other facet of the game ranges from disappointing to actively frustrating. There isn't much of a story beyond the fact that the boy-wizard has to walk through some levels and kill a really Mean and Bad wizard at the end. In each stage, certain special items must be collected before the boy can continue. Often all of the items but ONE will be very easy to find, and the player will then spend ages backtracking through the level searching for the last one.

This backtracking can pose a problem, since the levels aren't designed very well to begin with, and certainly aren't designed with going backwards in mind even though it is often a necessity to do so. Certain chasms can be leapt over going one way, but not the other, which means it's possible to get stranded and have to commit suicide by leaping into a hole in order to get another chance at finding all of the items without accidentally passing by one. Collecting little coins and treasures throughout the levels eventually leads to extra lives, however until the whereabouts of all items in a level have been memorized, the player can expect a lot of unfair game overs.

Level design is the biggest problem with the game, but there is also another major annoyance. Enemies don't react when they're hit. Nothing registers graphically, and more importantly, the enemy doesn't recoil or even slow down. The boy therefore has to keep running backwards while somehow simultaneously trying to shoot the enemy, otherwise the enemy will just walk right into him despite continuously taking damage.

Oh, and for all his tough-guy posturing, the boy shrieks like a girl when he gets hit.

So basically the only thing that's cool about Incantation is its name. Underneath the interesting title, however, is yet another mediocre platformer riddled with technical glitches and uninspiring gameplay.

Developer: Factor 5
Publisher: JVC
_________________________
*
The game is primarily action based, and the player controls Indy through levels based on events of the movies. Indy's main method of attack is his bull-whip, but he can also damage enemies by punching or rolling into them. Occasionally a gun can be found that has unlimited ammo, and grenades are available in limited amounts. Besides attacking, the whip can also be used as a method of swinging across pits. Once in a while, the game breaks the mold from the typical action and plunges the player into various other types of gameplay, such as flying a plane, riding a mine cart, and going down a mountain on a raft.

All three of the movies are featured in the game, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is the only one playable upon starting the game. In order to play the Temple of Doom and Last Crusade you have to progress through the game or use a password. The password system bypassed conventional lettering, opting instead to use the Greek alphabet. Like the Super Star Wars Trilogy, Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures is still regarded as an extremely challenging game to complete. Many levels are often quite long and include several enemies of all type, in some levels you have to fight with a villain from the movie in that you are playing. While the stages from Raiders and Last Crusade are of moderate difficulty, some levels from Temple of Doom (such as the Pankot caves) bring with them a very high level of difficulty and a large amount of traps and enemies.

Perhaps the most difficult stages in the game are the driving stages: The snowraft and mine car chase from Temple of Doom, and the biplane dogfight from Last Crusade, where the player has to avoid certain traps and enemies. If the player is defeated in these stages, he has to restart the entire level. Also if the player loses all of his lives in some area (for example Cairo in Raiders), he is forced to start all the stages of the area in which he was defeated.

Reception:

The game was fairly well received by critics and fans alike. AllGame praises the game's simple, but effective gameplay and controls and faithfulness to the source material. The game's graphics and music are also generally regarded positively (with music taken from John Williams's compositions of the films). In the negative side, a common complaint about the music was the limited use of music from all of the films (many of them taken from Raiders, three themes from Temple of Doom, and none taken from Last Crusade). Also many scenes from the films are not present in the game (the truck chase from Raiders, the boat and motorcycle chase along with the opening from Last Crusade). Also the "Choose Wisely" feature from previous games based on Last Crusade was omitted.

The player assumes the role of an Iga ninja whose village has been destroyed by the conquest of Oda Nobunaga. The ninja must travel across feudal Japan, enlisting the aid of numerous ninja, sages, hermits, ronin, samurai, wizards and other companions, in order to avenge his conquered clanfolk.

Several hazardous dungeons stand in the path of victory, as well as a selection of optional dungeons which can be played in any order the player chooses. Encounters with monsters and outlaws occur randomly in dungeons and in the game's world map, during which the player characters and NPCs can move around the battlefield in turn-based fashion to attack, cast magic spells and use items.

The main character can also participate in battles of a larger scale. By gaining the trust of a Japanese feudal lord, he can join in the battle for the provinces that characterized the era. The outcome of these battles changes the lords' possession of individual provinces, which can alter the outcome of the game and aid or hinder the player's progress.

In the middle of the stories, player can choose between the 'normal' path or the 'magician' path, selectable after completing the first dungeon quest. Different path leads to different enemies during random encounters. For example, 'magician' path causes Western type monsters such as Hellhound or Marchosias to appear

Tips:

Gain Money Without Passing Time
This method is a lengthy, but otherwise practical way to earn money without having to fight in battles or performing tasks that all use game time. First off, you need a Healer Companion on your team (Like a Sage or Hermit), and they have to have the Special Skill(s) Cure 1 and/or Cure 2. Second, you have to be in a Castle/Village that sells Health Food and/or Energy Pills. All skills in this game do not use magic, making this moneymaking method very practical. With the Cure 1, you can convert Health Food (that costs 40) into Body Healer items (that costs 80) and with theCure 2, you can convert Energy Pills to Energy Ups. Stock up on Health Food (Or Energy Pills if you have Cure 2), give them to your Healer, and use Cure 1 so that all Health Food turn into Body Healers.  Once you have all converted Health Food to Body Healers, sell these Body Healers for 56 Gold, earning a 16 gold piece profit. Same thing with Energy Pills, convert with Cure 2, and sell the Energy Ups for profits. Repeat the Buy, Convert, and Sell process as many times as you need to so you have all the money you can ever have so you can buy strong weapons and items in a town.

The player controls Inspector Gadget. When hit by an enemy, Gadget's clothing falls off, leaving him wearing only boxer shorts. The next hit causes Gadget to lose a life. Gadget's niece, Penny, and her dog, Brain, will assist Gadget during the game. The upper case font used in this game is the same one used for Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and other video games of the 1980s. However, the lower case font used is original and was not used in any previous video games.

Plot:

Something to note is Brain helps Gadget out very little and Gadget is actually self aware and actually fights the Mad Agents. At the end of every level except the sixth one Dr. Claw would send a robotic claw arm attached to a chair (similar to the one Gadget "arrests" in the cartoon's opening) with some type of device aiding it. The levels are based on places from the show they are: Dracula's Castle, Clock Makers clock tower, a South American jungle, king Tutonpoot's tomb and Dr. Claw's Winterland castle. At the end of the last level Dr. Claw escapes into an air ship but before going inside he turns toward the player and his face is half visible. The player must destroy the ship then they could proceed to fight Dr. Claw in his robot mech. After the fight Claw would retreat and Gadget would save Penny from falling out of the ship. When they landed Chief Quimby would send Gadget a note informing Gadget Dr. Claw had captured him.

International Superstar Soccer ("Live World Soccer Perfect Eleven" in Japan) is a soccer game developed by Konami for the Super NES. It is known as the best soccer game available for any 16-bit systems, mostly due to its lifelike approach, innovative for the time, that showed diversified players in the same team, with an adult look and back numbers on their respective jerseys, corresponding to real-life players of the time.

 - Open Game: A simple friendly match, that can be played against the CPU, another player, or just watched as the CPU controls both teams.

 - International Cup: A mode that emulates the FIFA World Cup, where teams are distributed in six groups of four teams each. The best 16 in this stage qualify to the knockout stage until the champion is known.

 - World Series: A league competition where all teams play against each other in a round-robin system.

 - Training: A series of challenges in different respects (dribbling, passing, shooting to the goal, defending and corner kick taking, in order), where the player must complete these challenges successfully under the established time, with the goal to sharpening the player's abilities.

 - Scenario: Enables the player to select one among nine matches running their courses, in order to achieve victory before time runs out (all matches start during the second half, and the player's team may be losing or tied). A draw results in failure.

 - Penalty Kick: A simple penalty kick match. Each team takes five shots alternately and, if there is no winner after these shots, they go into a sudden death round.

The game uses a password system in order to save and load International Cup and World Series matches.

Tips:

All Star team
Press B(2), X(2), A, Y, A, Y, Right, Left, X on controller two at the title screen.

Happy players

Genre: Sports , Soccer
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Konami
Publisher: Konami
_________________________

International Superstar Soccer Deluxe (ISS Deluxe) is the sequel to International Superstar Soccer (ISS), Konami's saga of soccer games.

ISS Deluxe has realistic animations and player sprites. The player can choose from 16 formations and 8 strategies and can compete with 36 national teams with recognizable celebrity players (like Valderrama, Baggio, Ravanelli, Petkov, ...), but their names are fictitious.

There are several competitions available: International Cup, World Series (League), Scenario Mode and customizable mini-cups/leagues.

The Deluxe version, released in the same year as ISS, contains several developments over the original. These changes refer to the SNES version.

 - It was made possible to play with two players co-operatively against the CPU

 - Extra commentary was added, although it was basic and consisted of a few set phrases such as "Down the wing!" and "Blocked shot!", which sometimes played a little too late, to comical effect

 - Player graphics and game AI were improved

 - Substitution and player selection was improved, making it possible to tell the type of player being selected, striker, defender, etc.

 - Activating one of the set strategies results in the name of the strategy appearing on screen

 - Corner kicks and direct free kicks no longer have a few seconds before taking where the camera pans around the players. It was made possible to control panning before the kick is taken

 - The timer shows a ring graphic which counts down the time in each half

 - It is possible to tackle the goalkeeper when the ball is out of play, frequently (but not always) resulting in a red card

 - Curling the ball became more pronounced, including the ability to curl kicks taken by the keeper

 - It's no longer possible to knock down the reporters standing behind the goal by hitting them with the ball.

Tips:

All Star Team
At the title screen press R, Up, Down, L, X, B, Left, A, Right, Y, if you did it correctly you will hear a dog's bark. Note: You have to use the 2nd controller (1st doesn't work at all for this code)

Dog Code
At the start screen, press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A and start. It must be done in the 2nd controller (doesn't work in the 1st)

Extra skill points
Enter edit players mode before the match and use all available skill points. Highlight the 'Cancel' option and press Y for 200 additional skill points.

Iron Commando
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (Europe)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Beat 'em Up , Side-Scrolling
Players: 2
_________________________
*
"The beat 'em up action is hard and intense, so why did they tack on these riding and shooting levels?"

For me, Iron Commando was the second hardest beat 'em up for the SNES/SFC to find a physical copy of (Birume Sentai Barayarou being the rarest and most expensive). Due to this, I had a sort of self-imposed hype built into the title, an expectancy that wasn't quite fulfilled when I actually started playing the game.

Graphics 8/10

By the standards set by other 1994 beat 'em ups, Iron Commando's visuals were good but not great. The enemies and backgrounds were above average in quality, and the animations by no means jagged. I was impressed, though, that there weren't any real graphical errors despite the screen being crowded by enemies rather often. The only time I can recall seeing flickering was when the enemies walked around the game over logo when I died.

Sound 7/10

Right around this time, beat 'em ups were reaching their peak in both quality and quantity. Meaning, music and sound effects that would have scored higher a year or so again have to be compared against a much larger array of titles. The music in Iron Commando was ok, although the first level starts off reminding me of this terrible pop-rock song I hear on the radio every day at the job. The sound effects were better, with multiple death cries for enemies and each gun sounding different when fired.

Control 8/10

While the brawling controls were usually spot-on, I wasn't as favorable to any levels that you rode on a motorcycle or within a mine cart. The dogs proved to be a real annoying enemy, mauling your character as you tried to get on the same plane as them. I often wasted every shell in my shotgun trying to fend off a pack of them while the projectiles soared over or under their bodies.

Game-play 7/10

When brawling, you're usually up against 4 to 5 different opponents at once. Unlike a lot of beat 'em ups, it it rather difficult to push the enemies ranks off to one side so you can battle without watching your back. Nearly every baddie is armed with either a knife or gun, so you'll only get to dust knuckles on infrequent occasions. The fighting is vicious, as even when you get a gun you'll have to keep the enemies at bay long enough on one side to obliterate the foes pouring in from the other.

A small annoyance is that you'll lose grip of your weapon if attacked, meaning if you're still interested in using it you'll have to risk another fraction of a second picking it back up. I hate fighting the dogs, which weave in and out of various positional planes and are almost impossible to hit with an intentional projectile. You'll have to get up close and dirty, grabbing them and landing a few punches to their immobilized bodies while avoiding the other enemies. As hard as this game can be at times, it does fill invigorating to make it through a level still clinging to a few scraps of your health bar. Which brings me to the other portions of the game - riding or driving segments. I'm not a big fan of these, in which you have to constantly shoot kamikaze enemies while dodging a bunch of clutter spread out before you. The bosses in these levels aren't any fun either, having to be defeated with very little space or fighting options present.

Lastly, unless you're fighting a boss - losing a continue sets you back to the start of the current stage.

Replay value 5/10

Although I am not too enthusiastic about some of the levels, I admit there is a draw to a game you can switch up between clubs, machine-guns, and your rugged fists within a moment's time. The two playable characters are almost the same, so you won't be experiencing an entirely different perspective by switching between them in a separate play-through.

Overall 7/10

I'm not entirely pleased with everything this game has to offer. The fighting, although fun - can be very frustrating as enemies whittle your life bar down with cheap shots. The riding levels shouldn't have been added, as they only compound the likeliness of a quick death with less interesting game-play. There are some sights to be seen, here - though. The first level boss is a car, that you have to destroy while infinite baddies pour out of it like they were all going to the prom. The melee and firearm combat is intertwined rather well, all though you'll be losing any weapon you have almost as soon as you pry it from a dead opponent's hands. If you somehow find a physical copy of this game for $30 dollars or less, I implore you snatch it up. Even if it isn't the greatest game ever, you'd be bound to make some profit selling it to a collector such as myself on various gaming forums.

Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Alexandria
Publisher: U.S. Gold
_________________________

"It goes for the Gold!!"

When I first played Izzy, a few years ago, I didn't know what to expect. I mean, a game about the Olympics? Well, let me tell you, this game is very surprising. I actually liked it, a lot! It features Izzy, the 1996 Olympics mascot in his quest to collect the Olympic rings. Now, on to the review!

Gameplay
This is a basic platformer, with well-designed levels. There is a Greek Village, The Underworld, complete with fire and whatnot, among many others. The actual gameplay is near flawless, as the controls are solid, and Izzy's moves flow smoothly. The best part about the game is the transforming. You can transform by collecting star-shaped powerups. You can become Archer Izzy, Fencing Izzy, Rocket Izzy, Hang-gliding Izzy, and shot-put Izzy. These each give you a special power or move. As fencing Izzy, you have a sword as a weapon, Hangliding Izzy can, uh, hang glide. This adds tremendous depth to the adventure.

Story
Your main quest is to collect the five Olympic rings, which are located in the ten massive levels. It will take all of Izzy's abilities to recover them all and restore the pride of the Olympics, from the servants of the Underworld. Not a bad storyline, and it flows well in the game.

Graphics/Sound
Izzy has bright colors, an smooth frame rate, and silky textures. The levels look beautiful, even when comparing them to the eye-candy that is Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. The backgrounds are overflowing with nicely colored details.
As for the music, it is very catchy. It is also very authentic, I guess (it sounds Greek). The sound effects are well timed and good, but not great.

Replay Value
As with the majority of platformers, Izzy does not have much replay value, as it is very linear and has no multiplayer. But since 95% of platformers don't, I wouldn't even take it into consideration. One good thing though, this game is pretty large. You won't get all of the bonus stages or other items the first time through. You will probably want to play it again.

Verdict
If you like platform games, definitely pick this one up. Even if you're not into platforming, still give it a try. You can't rent it anymore, so you'll have to buy it. At least it wont hurt your wallet, that's for sure. I bought mine for 3.99 In the bargain bin. So, if you are lucky enough to find it somewhere, don't hesitate, get this game.

Final Score: 8/10

Jelly Boy is a gelatinous humanoid pink blob on a mission throughout some strange worlds. He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies and obstacles. He can jump and he can launch a large fist from his stomach (he is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block so that he is unable to move for several seconds.

Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit knocks away all of his collected notes and if he gets hit again without having any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a variety of fruit throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types of fruit have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado = invincibility).

Marine and his friends went out for a day of fun at the Jelly Land Amusment Park. It was a fun day, lots of laughs. It was a real riot until a mysterious jester showed up. The Jester changed Marine and his friends into puddles of slime. Now Marine must find his way through the Jelly Land Amusment Park to find his friends, so they can battle the Jester and break his curse.

Along the way, you'll travel through eight worlds. The player has some choice in the order to play the levels through. As you play, you'll rescue Marine's friends. Each of them has a special talent, which will enable you to find your way through various puzzles, in order to find all the secrets. Most of the levels are pretty easy, but the bosses will present a decent challenge trying to defeat.

This game is the unreleased sequel to the platformer game Jerry Boy.

Translation Description:

KingMike presents a 100% complete translation of Jelly Boy 2. It is available in both IPS and NINJA patch format. KingMIke notes that this ROM WILL have a bad checksum, since it's a prototype game. Patch with the NINJA version and it's impossible to patch the wrong ROM.

Chris Covell did this translation. He was also responsible for a translation of this game's prequel, Jerry Boy.

Genre: Game Show

_________________________
*
PRESENTING JEOPARDY! Deluxe Edition FEATURING ALEX TREBEK for your SUPER NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM. With over 3,500 new questions in over 700 categories, amazing new digitized graphics and sound effects, you'll feel as if you're actually in the studio. Soon you'll experience the challenge of one of America's favorite TV game shows.

--From the SNES Jeopardy! Deluxe Edition instruction manual.

Overview:

Jeopardy is one of America's most popular and longest running game shows. It was spawned as an answer to the Quiz Show Scandals of the 50's. It came to light that the quiz shows of the 50's were rigged, and this installment was to be the first fair challenge. Naturally, it has spawned several video and board games.

This SNES version is pretty good. The graphics are nicely done, and the sounds are very close to the originals from the show. The gameplay is great because it comes directly from the game show. The controls are easy to use, it's just point and click on the action you want. The only complaint I had was that not only do you have to know the answer, but you also have to be able to spell it correctly. Other than that, it's a lot of fun. If you like Jeopardy, you'll love this game.

Directions:

Play the best game of Jeopardy you can. You can play against two other computer players, or you can play against one of your friends and one computer player. First, you get to pick what you want your character to look like.

After that you can put your name in, and the game will start.

Pick your category and try to answer the question, or question the answer in this case. The more questions you answer, I mean answers you question, the more money you will receive. Each correct response will award the point value associated with it, but an incorrect response will take that much money away from you. A Daily Double will allow you to decide on how much the answer is worth, you can wager up to your current score (thus Doubling your money, thus the name). There are two Daily Doubles per round.

Try to get as much money as you can before Final Jeopardy, where you will be given a category to decide how much of your money to bet. After you have made your wager, you will get a shot at questioning the final answer. If you end up with the most money, you win. 

Controls:

A Button - Enter/ Buzz In
B Button - Delete
Start Button - Start/ Done
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Spelling
Since the original Jeopardy game did not require you to be able to spell your answer, I don't consider this cheating. If you are unsure how to spell your answer, hit Esc. and ZSNES will be in window mode, thus pausing the game. Now go check your spelling with a dictionary or dictionary.com.

This...Is....Jeopardy!!!

If you have no idea what Jeopardy is, let me say you've been watching Wheel of Fortune and thinking that after that it was just some lame crap. But alas! Behind that show, involving the 50 year old beauty Vanna White, and the joking Pat Sajak, is a gameshow that defines "Fear". Just hearing the word Jeopardy can strike fear into anyone. It'll make you scared witnessing it. Especially the older games, both televised and video gaming. It will scare you when you see that Jeopardy logo staring you in the face. You'll have nightmares for life about that scary figure known as Alex Trebek, looking at you with a cold stare through his huge glasses. But then, go watch the Celebrity Jeopardy or the SCTV videos, or save yourself the time and trouble and just play this game.

The game, in my opinion, if it was made after 1994, after the ESRB came to be, should be Rated T for Teen. Many of the young players will never get any of the questions right... for them, I suggest Jeopardy Junior Edition for the NES, or if they're sports fanatics, then Jeopardy Sports Edition is their game. Another thing about this game, is the creepy graphics. I highly suggest you play Deluxe Edition to avoid seeing Trebek's mouth move. And trust me... it's creepy.

Directions:

You get the answers to questions. You just have to question the answer. Simple, isn't it? 

Controls:

A Button - Picks letters, Rings in
B Button - Buzzes in, Backspaces
Start Button - Goes to game after main menu
Select Button - Picks New Categories

Hints:

Having Great Savvy when Wagering
There's only one way to go in Jeopardy...your wagering. You're between a cold stone and a hard rock when you're in a Daily Double or Final Jeopardy. So let me give you some tips.

-If you're playing alone, it doesn't matter how much you wager...as long as you leave a dollar. That dollar is going to give you the victory.... I won with 2 dollars once. Felt like Celebrity Jeopardy.

-If you're playing against someone in the Final Jeopardy, and you're, say 1000 below them, it's bottom line you wager you wager everything you've got unless you're absolutely sure you've got no chance of getting the question right.

-However, if you're at 7000, and your closest opponent has 3000, multiply your opponent's score by 2...then you take that number (6000) and you subtract it from your score. (1000) now take off one dollar...if you wager this amount (999, in this situation) you're never going to lose the game.

"A game that sports fans and Jeopardy fans will enjoy."

Allow me to regale you with a tale. On a sunny, early-summer afternoon in 2004, an individual walked into a thrift store, hoping to score some cheap classic games. This individual was elated to find a few titles for the Super Nintendo Entertainment system. While the titles are now all but forgotten, along with those games was Jeopardy! Sports Edition. Unbeknownst to this individual, he accidentally was still holding this title when he went to the counter to pay. Lost in the excitement of the glorious find, he did not realize he had purchased it. When he arrived at his home that night and went to play the games he had gleefully purchased earlier, this title fell out of the bag.

With a dumbfounded look about his face, he pondered how he acquired this game along with the others. 'Surely I put this one back,' he thought to him self. However, after a quick look at the receipt, he did indeed purchase this unwanted game. Now this was a hardcore role playing gamer. A title like this did not belong in this man's collection. A scoff arose from his lips as he thought he wasted two of his dollars. Surely if this man had not been overcome by awe at the other titles, this one would still be sitting at that thrift store, two towns away.

However, this is a fair man and he thought to give the game a chance once before returning it the next day. What this man was not expecting was that not only would this be an enjoyable game, but it would still be in his collection, even to this very day.

Now Jeopardy is an interesting concept. It is a television show created by Merv Griffin where the players are given the answers and must come up with the questions. Jeopardy! Sports edition is an incarnation of this concept, created solely for use on the Super Nintendo Entertainment system and filled with only sports trivia.

The game works much like the show. Three contestants answer questions (or rather question answers) for money. The harder the answer, the more money he or she earns. Now while the show actually gives money, the game cart does nothing but grant bragging rights to the smartest individual.

As many as three people can play this game, and as few as one. The game offers a few choices of a character you can play as. All characters represent some facet of the sports world from star basketball players to world class ice skaters. The only prejudice is towards football as no football player can represent the human player.

The only conceivable people who will enjoy this game fall into two categories: Those who like sports trivia and those who like the show Jeopardy. The player will quickly realize that this game moves at a much slower place than the actual show. You get one minute to respond to an answer after ringing in. You have to spell out your answer using the directional pad and the A button. A correct answer nets you the dollar amount the clue was worth while an incorrect answer costs you the value of the clue.

While it may be a simple concept, there are some twists. In addition to the fact that there are Daily Doubles hidden throughout the clues and the obvious competition from opposing players is the relative obscurity that the clues bring along with them.

In order to succeed, the player must have vast knowledge of all areas of sports, ranging from football to horse racing to boxing to Olympics. Players must know history, icons, equipment, and many other things that most people would not consider for a brief mili-second. This brings an added sense of difficulty, especially to those not familiar with cricket or curling.

Graphically, the game is what one would expect from an early Super Nintendo title. Alex Trebek's image is inserted, in all his pixilated glory. The clue board can be viewed all at once without any loss of readability. The background changes to red when in double Jeopardy. Your avatar even smiles when responding correctly and becomes sadden when incorrect. This is certainly not the mind blowing graphics of many other games, but it gets the job done. After all, the show its self is not flashy, so, why should the game be?

If one can get over the constant sound byte of "And the answer is," he and or she will quickly realize that this game offers nothing in terms of sound quality. A couple of realistic sounds from Trebek and Johnny Gilbert as well as the final Jeopardy song is all this game has to offer. While it does hold true to the show in the respect that there is no background music, the lack of said music makes for a boring, dull experience. Some sort of looping soundtrack would make this game more enjoyable.

Controlling the game is so easy that someone who has never experienced a video game before will be able to grasp the concept in a matter of seconds. A quick press of a few different buttons and you can enter your response and prepare for the jubilation of being correct or the laughing scorn or your friends and family for being incorrect. Essentially, you are offered the alphabet and a cursor. The player must move the cursor along the alphabet and by using the A button, select each letter in the response he or she wishes to give. When the question is complete, a press of the start button confirms it. And before you ask, no, you do not have to answer in the form of a question. The 'who is' or 'what is' is already inputted for you.

In a way, this game holds true to the television show as much as possible. The best aspect of the game is that the player can enter a number of variations to a response and still be correct. For instance, if the correct response is "National Football League," the player can enter that long response, or a shortened response of "NFL." Similarly, one can enter numbers in their Arabic form or in their spelled form. "Seven" and "7" are both acceptable, and correct, responses. This makes for a lot less frustration that would be predominant if this were not the case.

Frustration is something that a hardcore Jeopardy fan may incur. The game is very slow moving because each person gets 60 seconds to respond to a clue if he or she rings in. Not only that, but there are 10 seconds that need to pass by before the clue is determined to be invalid. Should someone ring in with 2 seconds remaining and respond incorrectly, seven seconds are placed back on the clock and the all must run out again before the correct response is given. There is no time limit in each round, which helps to make up for this downfall.

One would have to surmise that this game is not for everyone. The target audience is small. However, anyone who enjoys sports, the show, or just a good party game, should look into Jeopardy! Sports Edition. While you certainly will not find the greatest game available for the SNES, you will find a game that is good to pull out and play once or twice a year. This game is surprising for what it is, so if you see it for two bucks at a thrift store, go ahead and intentionally purchase it. It certainly is worth two bucks, as I found out that summer day in 2004.

This game came out in the US, but under the name Smart Ball. So why translate it? Well, pretty much the whole story was cut out in the US release, such as the intro and towns, which is a damn shame, considering the game makes a hell of alot more sense with them in it. You play the part of a guy who rules a kingdom with his brother, which is going along just fine until you decide to marry this princess. Unfortunatly, your brother gets pissed off, (I guess he can't find his own woman or something.), and lets some mysterious wizard guy turn you into an amorphous slime ball so he can take your girlfriend, and rule the kingdom by himself. Naturally you must beat the wizard and your brother's ass, and with your super secret slime powers, you have a chance. Not only can you jump, turn into a phallic looking glob, and climb walls, but you can also find little balls to shoot at crap. I guess it's a good thing the wizard didn't just kill you instead of giving you all these abilities, but then there'd be no game, huh?

I've always considered myself to be really good at platformers, but this game had me ripping my hair out at certain parts. At first I thought it'd be a walk in the park, but no, some of the levels are really damn tricky (Not Dragon's Lair for NES tricky, but then again, I don't think anything's that hard, except maybe Battle Toads.), even sadistic at times. Despite the difficulty, it's a really fun game, and definitly worth a spin on your SNES emulator of choice, especially if you've played Smart Ball and want to see what all you missed out on.

Translation Description:

This is Chris Covell's first translation project, and it turned out pretty well I think. There were a couple of graphic bugs in the original game that he fixed as well.

"My Opinion: For People Who Know About Wild C.A.T.S"

Introduction

This game was inspired by the Wild C.A.T.S comic created by Jim Lee.

Story

The story is like a comic book story. The Wild C.A.T.S have to defeat the demonites and their leader, Helspont.

Graphics

The graphics are good. The sprites are detailed well and so are the environments. All the characters you play as seem to look the same in the comic books.

Audio

The audio decent. The music isn't really exciting not memorable. There are very few SFX. They seem to be original. I never heard most of them before. The only thing I didn't like about the SFX is when you beat the enemies up. I didn't like the fact that everyone has the same SFX when their getting beat up.

Controls

The controls are a little hard to use. Movement is a little slow. The controller seems to respond immediately. When you attack it seems to hae a slight problem. You would have to play it to find out.

Gameplay

Well, its a beat em up so don't expect much. But there seem to be new things in this that haven't been seen in a beat em up game. You start out as the character Spartan for the first two levels. Then you can choose three of the Wild C.A.T.S. Spartan, Maul, and Warblade. Your all now on a mission. At points in the gameplay (with the characters you play as), they need a Wildcat to do something so they can get past a certain part. That can mean you'll have to play as one of the three characters they let you choose from. I haven't seen that in a beat em up game before. At the end, you can choose one of the three characters you get to choose from. I suggest you use Maul.

Conclusion

This game has very few things I haven't seen in a beat em up game. This game to me is for people who know about Wild C.A.T.S. I really don't know anything about Wild C.A.T.S but yet I've played the game. The only thing I know about it is that Jim Lee created it and they were comic books. I may have enjoyed this game more if I knew about Wild C.A.T.S.

Anyways only get this if you know about Wild C.A.T.S and if you like beat em up games too.

Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D is a platform game designed by French developer Loriciel and published by Electro Brain for the Super NES in 1993. The game features several contrasting modes of gameplay, including side-view platforming, top-view, and horizontal shoot 'em up. It follows Jim Power in Mutant Planet from the Jim Power series.

Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D is often considered by gaming aficionados to be one of the most difficult games ever made.[1][2] Despite its name, it is an entirely 2D game, although the game uses many layers of parallax scrolling backgrounds moving in opposite directions to give a great sense of depth. Together with the 3D glasses that were packaged with the game, designed around the Pulfrich effect, this provided a unique "3D" experience for the time when polygonal 3D graphics were rudimentary and too expensive to implement.

The soundtrack was composed by Chris Hulsbeck of Turrican fame.

Jimmy Connors Pro Tennis Tour is a video game developed by Blue Byte and released in 1993. It is the second video game to feature Jimmy Connors after his name was used for the 1993 game, Jimmy Connors Tennis.

The play is simple. The longer you hold the button down, the harder your return shot flies off. Each of the buttons represents a different kind of shot, and your selection of shots will change depending on whether you are serving, playing from the baseline, or roaming close to the net. The directional pad is used for placing your serves and shots. It's simple to get into and difficult to master.

There is an Easy mode for the controls, which allows the computer to control the movement of your player, and you worry about the shot; this is great for beginners.

So has this ever happened to you? You're sitting there with your bud, and you just got finished with a dinosaur demolition derby (Tyrannasaurus Wrecks), and a bunch of Neandrithals storm into your village and scare away all the cave babes. No?! Well, that's what happened with our pre-historic heroes, Joe and Mac. Now they have to run our pre-history and save the beautiful cave babes.

Joe and Mac is a fun game with excellent graphics that keep you chuckling and a sound track that fits the game's zany nature. This game is fun and humorous, so have fun, Gamer.

Directions:

Joe and Mac is a beat-em-up / platformer that takes place in the Stone Age. Start out in the "level select" area which is much like Super Mario 3. Run to the grey circles to save your progress and the red circles to play the level.

Run around each level beating up on Neandrithals and little dinosaurs. Your health is marked on the upper left hand corner of the screen and can be increased by food that can be found along your way or dropped by the bad guys.

Use your club and other weapons you find along the way that you can throw, such as bones, fire, and boomerangs. Fight your way through each level to get to the boss, a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex or Pterodactyl, and save a cave babe. Save all the cave babes and you win!

Just for you people that don't like playing alone, team up with a friend and play two player mode. Play as both Joe and Mac, although there is no difference in the way either of them play, and save the babes together. Good Luck, Cave Man, and go get your girls back. 

Controls:

A Button - JUMP
B Button - JUMP
X Button - ATTACK
Y Button - ATTACK
Start Button - PAUSE
Select Button - SWITCH SUB-WEAPON

Tips:

Replay level
To replay a level that you have already beaten, simply go to that level on the map and press START, SELECT!

Extra lives
To get extra lives, simply play those levels that have them again. Once you've collected them, press START, SELECT to return back to the world map. Repeat as required!

Bonus levels
Kill all the small dinosaurs before cracking the red egg in the middle of level 8. A bonus level will begin where your weapon may be powered up. The bonus level also contains a key that allows entry to the blue dots on the map. Another red egg that leads to a bonus level is at the beginning of level 9.

Continue at dinosaur in last level
If you lose a life inside the dinosaur, select 'Yes' to continue. The map with the last continue location will
appear. Begin game play at that location, then press Start, Select. The game will resume inside the dinosaur.

"A little known game gets an even more little known sequel, and it's awesome"

Joe and Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics

Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 10/10
Sound: 8/10
Ingenuity: 7/10
Replay Value: 7/10

Joe and Mac is a classic, and very overlooked series for the 16-bit systems featuring two cavemen who are trying to find an evil guy who stole a sacred crown from their village. For some reason, they have to find seven stones along the way before they can face the final boss. Not many people have played the first game, and even less have played the second. This is quite a shame since Data East put a lot of work into these two games, and made something that's quite a lot of fun to play.

The gameplay is simple; yet very fun. You play as either Joe, or Mac, and make your way through several levels on your quest to get back the crown. It plays pretty similar to a lot of other side scrollers of the day, and we all know that those were a dime a dozen back in the day. However, this is a lot more exciting than a lot of those other games, most of which were?..less than appealing. This sequel is quite a bit different than the first game in the way that it's set up. In the first Joe and Mac, you had to play every level in a specific order, but in this game you can choose which levels you play in what order thanks to a handy over world. Your character has a simple set of moves. Pretty much just a button for attack, and a button for jumping, but it's best not to mess with perfection. As you progress through each level, there are weapon power ups to be found.

At first, you just have a normal club, but as you get power ups, your club is upgraded to shoot out different things. How a club manages to spawn fire, bones, boomerangs, and even stone tires is beyond me, but it's damn cool. The levels in Joe and Mac 2 have several advancements over the ones found in the first game, primarily the inclusion of more interactive environments, and dinosaurs that you can ride like vehicles. The environments are a great step forward, and are better than many of the more popular side scrollers of the day. In the lava level, you must quickly run through a cave to avoid the magma coming up behind you. Enemies will see the lava coming and start to run with you as you all try to escape from the flames.

In the ice level, icicles fall from the ceilings of caves allowing you to get on top of them as they fall and reach higher places if you jump quick enough. The dinosaurs are a pretty cool addition, but they really aren't that big of a part of the gameplay. They're a lot of run to ride when you get the chance since they spit fire, or ice, or something along those lines, but they don't add a whole lot to the experience. The enemy cavemen are varied and very inspired. They remind me a lot of the enemy soldiers found in the Metal Slug series. The cavemen will try to sneak up on you and smack you in the head with their clubs, or point and run in fright if something bad is coming at them like a dinosaur or lava. The other enemies are themed with the levels and include giant plants, dinosaurs, yetis, and any other prehistoric monster that you can possibly think of. The end of the level bosses are big, and pretty fun to fight. 

Difficulty really isn't that much of a factor in this game. Much like the first title in the series, it can be completed in an hour or so, and isn't tough until the last boss. Two-player mode adds a lot of replay value to the game. It's a blast to go though levels with a friend co-op style, but I didn't feel the need to go though a second time by myself.

The graphics are absolutely wonderful. Every level is lush with detail and color. The environments are very interactive and amazing. Each enemy has a lot of comical expressions, and will act very advanced for a Super Nintendo game. Every time I pop this game into my system for a run, it never ceases to amaze me with its wonderful graphics and pretty characters. Data East really went all out with this one and pushed the system to its limits. There are few 16-bit games that look as good as Joe and Mac 2. It is truly a show of what the king of consoles is capable of doing. If you're a fan of 2D graphics, don't let this game pass you by. Hunt it down, and try it out. Screen shots won't do it justice.

Despite the awesome graphics, the sound isn't anything too special. Some of the sound effects are pretty good, but for the most part, they're just average. The music is good in most levels, but it's nothing that's going to be stuck in your head, and it won't have you running out to buy the OST. It compliments the game, but it's nothing amazing or awesome.

This really is an underrated game. Few have ever played it, and it's very hard to find. If you ever get a chance to play this little known gem, by all means do. It's a wonderful title, and one of the best side scrollers on the Super Nintendo. The graphics are absolutely splendid, and the gameplay is very refreshing and a lot of fun with a friend. If you love 2D action games, then this is for you. You might have a very hard time getting your hands on it, but if you can, then buy this as soon as you see it.

Final Score (Not an average): 87%

Easy defense
Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 92 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place. When the ball is snapped, you'll usually have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.

Title screen zoom
Hold any button and tap Start until the screen blanks and displays a close-up of the crowd. Release the button to start the game.

John Madden Football '93 is a football video game released in 1992 by Electronic Arts. While technically just an update of the '92 game, this one set the bar for most Madden games to follow.

This is the second Madden game for the Super Nintendo. The John Madden games have been a commercial success and have appeared on the Sega Genesis, the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, Sega Game Gear, and Nintendo Game Boy.

The game is featured in the collector's edition of Madden NFL 09 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as an exclusive bonus, including updated rosters for the 2008-2009 season.

Features:

John Madden Football '93 featured 28 updated teams from the '91-'92 season, as well as 10 new teams: 2 All-Madden teams and 8 Greatest ever teams. The teams featured in the game were represented by city names. There were no player names, logos, or arena names used, due to those rights being held by the NFL and the NFLPA. John Madden Football '93 was the first in the Madden series to incorporate "split-play calling", overturning of certain calls by referees, the use of the No-Huddle Offense, and player taunting.

Easy defense
Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 93 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place. When the ball is snapped, you'll usually have plenty of
time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.

_________________________

Blue Antoid's seminal, acclaimed, n00btastic work. It's the first full-length hack of EB, though it came before any sort of map or compressed graphics editing. It was also pretty much made up on the spot, with no real plan - just an accumulation of random ideas and plot threads gleaned from a forum topic, and tied together with minty dental floss. It generally follows the EarthBound story line (if not the plot) in a "new" scenario with new characters and enemies. (Most people hail JonBound as the Holy Grail of EB hacking, but Blue Antoid really hopes a newcomer will arrive and blow it away. Problem is he's been waiting since 2001!)

The Law

The few inhabitable areas left in America are sprawling metropolitan areas covering what used to be the states. In between the three Mega- Cities lies the wasted radiation desert called the Cursed Earth, created during the Great Atomic War of 2070, where mutants spawn and retiring Judges go for The Long Walk...A world where automation and robotics have made unemployment the rule, where caffeine dealers risk their lives to sell a quick jolt to restless, embittered citizens, and where mere littering can earn you jail time in an Iso-Cube.

Welcome to Mega-City One, home to 400 million citizens. Here up to 60,000 people exist in soulless self-contained city blocks that provide cradle-to Resyk living, if the inhabitants aren't destroyed in the vicious intra-block rivalries that erupt into Block Wars. Within the dreary confines of this enormous sprawl, order is no longer kept by a police force. In the year 2139 A.D., the seething citizens of the world are judged not by their peers, but by Judges, unforgiving, authoritarian keepers of the peace who believe in speedy justice. Justice is dispatched on the spot.

Judge Dredd finds himself on the wrong side of the law as unseen forces work to bring him down

In the game, the player controls Alan Grant, and the objective of the game is to complete certain tasks in order to escape, such as clearing a raptor nest of eggs, and turning the generator on in a utility shed, allowing for opening and closing of gates and the like. Communication ports set up around the island allow characters in the game to communicate advice to the player, though some advice is deliberately malicious. Jurassic Park supports the SNES Mouse when playing first-person sequences or operating computer terminals. The game's soundtrack consists of various music that corresponds to the area the player is currently exploring (except the two Tyranosaurus Rexes who have their own theme track). The game typically takes 2-3 hours to complete, though some objectives, such as collecting all 18 raptor eggs, can slow down a player's progress. The current world record for fastest completion, however, is one hour and nineteen minutes, held by Paul Inglehart[1]. 

There is no way to save the game, thus, requiring players to play through the entire game in a single sitting.

The game's first person sequences play similarly to those of Wolfenstein 3D, mostly due to the 90-degree limitations on wall angles. The only enemies encountered during these sequences are Velociraptors, who typically walk along a set path and only attack when the player nears, and Dilophosaurus, who stand in place, but spit toxins from afar.

Tips:

Spitters to Raptors glitch
Collect Bola ammo and Tranquilizer ammo and then enter a building. Find a Dilophosaurus (aka. Spitter) aim towards it. Fire a bola, then a tranquilizer dart immediately after the bola. As soon as the dart impacts with the explosion a raptor will appear in place of the spitter and fall to the ground, sedated.  Eventually the raptor will get up and attack like most indoor raptors do. This glitch only works on spitters that are indoors.

Jurassic Park 2 featured a cinematic opening (complete with audio dialogue, a rarity in those days) explaining that the main competitor of InGen, Biosyn, is sending in troops and scientists in an attempt to gain control of Isla Nublar for their own purposes. The instruction booklet indicates that InGen CEO John Hammond has personally asked Dr. Alan Grant (First Player) and a soldier named Michael Wolfskin (Second Player) to bring the island under control after Biosyn's attack. The game is based on an original sequel story to the original Jurassic Park film.

Jurassic Park 2 follows up its impressive cut scene with conventional side-scrolling run and gun style. The player(s) can select their level from a list and play through the game's stages in any order; however, "emergency" missions also appear after each level is completed, and the order of these stages does not change. Some stages offer a simple flat design, some have a platforming focus and others feature a maze of doorways which must be navigated to locate the exit.

Grant and Wolfskin can choose among three lethal weapons (rifle, machine gun, shotgun), and three non-lethal weapons (electric stun gun, tranquilizer gun, and gas grenade launcher). The lethal rounds are effective against humans and dinosaurs, while the non-lethal rounds are designed to incapacitate dinosaurs without killing them, so as to preserve InGen's investment; if the number of dinosaurs killed with lethal weapons by the player becomes too high, the game will end. Non-lethal rounds do not affect humans.

Tips:

Infinite Continues
At the Mission Select screen, press Press L(3), R(3), L(2), R(2), L, R, L(2), R(2), L(3), R(3)

Extra Missions
By playing the game on the medium difficulty you'll be able to play a final extra mission at the end of the game that is not accessible on the easy difficulty. In the mission you must kill the T-Rex to beat it.  By playing the game on the hard difficulty you'll have to first defeat the T-Rex in the mission mentioned above, then you must play another final mission not accessible on the other difficulties. You must escape the island in a helicopter while trying to shoot down another helicopter.

New Weapon
After completing the fourth emergency mission a new weapon is acquired. It is a non-lethal weapon and is much more powerful than the Tranq. bazooka, but it comes with no ammunition and is loaded one shot at a time.

Pretty much your standard 2-D fighter. You've got nine playable characters for Battle Mode, but only the six Good Guys (and Gal) for Story Mode. Basically, in Story Mode your mission is to save the world from Dark Seid who is trying to take over the world. Just like any comic book villain would, I mean, it's his job, right? In Battle Mode you take on the computer and see how long you can last. In Versus Mode you get to test your super powers against those of your friends. Please don't try this at home. You can't really fly, and you don't have heat vision. Although a magic lasso can be handy at times...

If you love DC superheroes, then you'll get a kick out of this game. The characters are well-rendered as far as accurate costumes and powers, although the animation isn't great. On the other hand, you expect a few more playable characters and a lot more special moves from a game like this, even way back then. The sound is where I would have to say this game really shines. Each character has his or her own theme song that plays while fighting on their stage, which actually serves to set the mood for each fight. And the sound effects for the special moves are pretty groovy as well. The backgrounds are less spectacular, but at least they keep changing so you aren't staring at the same screen all day.

Directions:

All right, I admit it. I pretty much suck at this game. But that doesn't mean the game sucks. The game sucks for other reasons entirely. Well, maybe it's not so bad if you don't suck at it. 

But maybe it is. My real complaint has to be about the controls, or lack thereof. Actually it's not how the controls are set-up, it's just that they don't work. The kicks, punches, and special moves are pretty much standard fare for 2-D fighting games, but on this one they seem less responsive for some reason. Also the choppy animation makes it hard to react to your opponent's moves and hard to know whether your own character is actually doing what you tell him.

Overall, I would say if you're a fan of super hero comics, check this game out. Otherwise, give it a miss and just play Street Fighter or something. Wait, this game came out after Mortal Kombat 2, which I just reviewed. That makes it even worse! I was thinking it was contemporary with other not-so-great games, but this is really bad! 

Controls:

A Button - Medium Kick
B Button - Light Kick
X Button - Medium Punch
Y Button - Light Punch
L Button - Heavy Punch
R Button - Heavy Kick
Start Button - Start, Pause

Hints:

Cheater!
OK, some of these characters can fly. Flying is cheating. But as one of my karate instructors used to say, "If you ain't fightin' dirty, then you ain't fightin'!!" So take an early lead with a range weapon, then "Up, up and away!" and just stay out of your opponent's reach. Of course, it won't work if he can fly too. Or she.

Original Title: Juutei Senki

Jutei Senki is a very simplistic strategy RPG, that doesn't bother with any kind of between-battle kind of story at all, short of the battle's title. Kind of refreshing, but the intro is just so cool! It really makes you wonder what the hell is going on, other than people just, you know, fighting each other. There's no real rules as far as unit type goes either; apart from their stats (strength, defense, range, anti-air capability, etc.), a Toy is a Bobby is a Jaggy is a Rider, pretty much. So if you're looking for some kind of amazing Tactics Ogre this-beats-that-but-not-this game, this is not the one to look forward to.

As soon as you click on a unit, its range lights up in a circle around it. You can move around anywhere in that circle, terrain and other units permitting. Which is cool. Once you attack an enemy, there's a wicked little battle animation that shows your unit attacking. Honestly, this is the highlight of the game. Those just plain rock. The hizzouse. As far as the rest of the graphics go, though? eh. They're just a bunch of tiny little icons, so what do you expect.

Translation Description:

While some stuff needs some work (the tutorial in particular looked pretty dodgy), most of it you won't notice, because there's not much text in the game, and what little text you DO see a lot, is done really well, so no worries. Just play the game.

Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.

The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.

The birth of the National Pastime

Baseball in the United States began modestly in the 19th century as a variation of many games that made use of a ball and some sort of bat. Throughout this time, baseball's growth mirrored the growth of the United States. By the turn of the century, the country had boomed through the Industrial Revolution with cities growing at an alarming rate. Likewise, baseball had evolved into a professional sport where spectators paid to watch skilled athletes play a child's game.

The popularity of amateur baseball clubs that played between 1845-1865, led to the introduction of the first professional baseball club, the Cincinnati Red Stockings. The Red Stockings' success against the amateur teams provided incentive to create America's first professional baseball league, the National Association of Baseball Players in 1871. Though the new league was not a complete success, it significantly increased baseball's popularity across the land.

WILLIAM AMBROSE HUBERT, President of the Chicago club, and AL SPALDING, a pitcher in Boston, believed that reforms were needed to protect baseball from the corruption and instability that surrounded the National Association. At a meeting in Louisville in 1876, Hubert, Spalding, and representatives of the St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Louisville baseball clubs designed a set of guidelines for a new league, named the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs. The National League contained eight charter clubs, however, between 1876 and 1900, only Chicago and Boston fielded a team each year.

During the first two decades of its existence, the National League withstood threats of competition from newer professional leagues. In the 1890s, the National League's dominance weakened after growing to 12 teams, an unmanageable number for that period. Although baseball remained the country's favorite sport, it was gaining a reputation for rowdiness and dirty play that didn't match the era. This prompted Byron Banford "Ban" Johnson and Charles Albert Comiskey to found a league based on strong leadership and good virtue. In the American League, games were not played on Sunday and women were encouraged to attend ball games. Johnson and Comiskey set a goal to establish a new image for the game. Recognizing that its power had declined partially by managing too many teams, the National League sold four clubs to the new league in 1900.

Following this transaction, National League officials still scoffed at the new league when it began play in 1901. However after luring many premier National League players with higher salaries and running a "kinder, gentler" league, American League attendance exceeded National League attendance by 600,000 fans in 1902. Early in 1903, the National League granted the American League status as a Major League. With this, came a consistent scheduling system, player contract regulations, and playing guidelines that the two leagues would share. Another product of this agreement was the World Series, which pitted the American League Champion against the National League Champion in a nine game series (later shortened to seven games) that would determine the World Champion of Baseball.

In 1903, 16 franchises competed for the first World Series Championship. Though some of these teams have since moved to new locations or changed their names, the modern era of baseball began in 1903 with the same goal that exists today.

THE GAME PLAN

Baseball's most popular and exciting player, Ken Griffey Jr., adds his name and baseball expertise to Nintendo's newest Super NES baseball game. It was the fifth game of the 1995 American League Wild Card Playoffs. Down by one run in the bottom of the eleventh inning, the Seattle Mariners, with Ken Griffey Jr. up to bat, were setting the stage for the most exciting finish in a divisional series. Ken Griffey Jr. smacked a single to center field to advance a runner to third base. Then the American League batting champ stepped into the batter's box and drove a pitch to left field; one run scored easily to tie the game.

But Wait! Here come Ken Griffey Jr. rounding third. He's going to try the impossible, scoring from first base. The throw to the plate is on its way. Ken Griffey Jr. hits the dirt. The throw is not in time! The Seattle Mariners advance to the American League Championship Series, thanks in part to Ken Griffey Jr.'s winning run!

Kendo is Japanese fencing. Centuries ago some samurai decided it was more fun and much safer to practice swordplay with bamboo swords instead of steel swords. Jo is into Kendo in a big way. A black belt in karate by the time she was twelve, Jo began looking for a new challenge. She found it in Kendo- Japanese swordsmanship.

Now Jo's parents are pretty cool. They sent her to Japan for summer vacation to study under Osaki Yoritomo, Japan's greatest Kendo master. Jo was jazzed until she got off the plane in Tokyo. Osaki sensei had green hair and called himself "Bob". Wouldn't you wonder if your "great sword teacher" looked like some psycho-cyberpunk with green hair? It gets better.

Bob starts ranting about all your special psychic powers and how it's your duty to banish evil from the world. Then he hands you the Zopikki talisman. Kind of neat but it turns you into some kind of retro 70's super hero. Bob might be the greatest sword master of all time, but he's not a fashion designer. Bob is either crazy or a genius, but you know this will be the weirdest summer vacation of all time.

Kendo, the Way of the Sword, has a long history in Japan. Thousands of years ago Japanese warriors studied Kenjutsu, the Art of the Sword, to hone their martial skills. As civil wars in feudal Japan heated up, the study of swordsmanship became more important. Skilled swordsmen opened their own dojos to train samurai in the Art of Fighting. As you can guess training with a live blade was just as dangerous as combat! Finally a great master developed a bamboo sword to train with. This allowed a warrior to work on form and style without the threat of injury. Over the years, Kendo has become a full fledged sport with a growing international following. For more information on how you can study Kendo and learn the Way of the Sword, contact:

--From the SNES Kendo Rage instruction manual.

Kevin Keegan's Player Manager

Genre: Sports , Soccer
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Anco Games
Publisher: Imagineer
_________________________

Kevin Keegan's Player Manager is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System football (soccer) game where the player takes a football team and manages them to win games and eventually the championship. The player does not control each individual player directly. Instead, he designs plays and acquires players from other teams in order to make the perfect team. Kevin Keegan was one of the more popular football managers during the 1990s. The graphics were considered minimalist in contrast to games released in North America and that is why the game was never released there.

The game was written by Steve Screech for Anco Software in the UK and Imagineer in Japan

It was simple to play and was very quick; it was possible to complete a season in just two hours. There was only forty-eight teams in a three division structure. When the game began, the 'Kevin Keegan' character was a 28-year-old. When he becomes 35 years old at the end of the 2000 season and declares his retirement, it was not possible to control the players during a match from that point onwards. Controlling the players was also impossible if he missed a game to injury or being put in reserves. However after a few more seasons you could sign his nephew or other family member and you are then again able to control the players on the pitch. This aspect of the game makes interactivity with the players on the field very difficult as compared to a modern football simulation like FIFA 08 where players can control their men at all times.

Kick Off was the first soccer game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other soccer games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.

The third entry in the Kick Off series is the first that offers a isometric view instead of the old top-down view. In the game there are four competitions (World Cup Finals, League, Knock Out Cup and the challenge). There is several options for game speed and ball control to suit both novice and skilled gamers. Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has "key players", such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation. The difference is that in the Arcade mode you can switch of rules to focus purely on reflexes.

"Crazy Chase is probably a game best left in the past."

Released around the same time as Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong Country, Kid Klown in Crazy Chase never really had a chance and maybe that was for the best. Part of the game's problem wasn't the competition (though that didn't help), rather that it was overtly tricky; not just due to the claustrophobic, isometric viewpoint the game utilises, but also because everything in this game was out to get you; from slippery banana peels, to very friendly ghosts with large tongues! Add to that a harsh time limit and the unforgiving layout of later levels and you basically had a recipe for frustrating gamers.

The story is hence: As the klutziest clown of Clown World (a planet of clowns of course), Kid Klown has been given the job of rescuing Princess Klown from the villain clown Blackjack who has done what most bad guys, clowns or otherwise do with Princesses in the world of video games, in that he has kidnapped her. On route Kid accidentally presses the panic button - never a good idea - and blows up his own, err, spaceship! Anyway Blackjack being the stereotypical villain that he is, decides that rather than use this as an opportunity to escape he'll instead setup bombs on the game's five levels in order to get rid of the pest once and for all.

Each level requires you to outrun the, very, very long fuse of one of Blackjack's bombs, in-between you'll be dodging and squeezing past pretty much everything that could stand in a small clown's way: from rolling logs, fire hydrants and puddles of water, to boulders, hurdles and, of course, Blackjack himself (who appears at various points on each level). All these things and more will attempt to knock you flat on Kid's little clown face, sapping health and stalling progress. The levels themes fulfil the general cliches of gaming, including the generic forest level, an ice world and a larva land; all with matching hazards to scamper round and try to avoid.

Thanks to the camera being so close to the action, you will see every pratfall and pained expression in all its great cartoon detail; and everything is beautiful to look at and quite well animated, especially Kid himself. Unfortunately with the action so closed in, you won't have a lot of time to see what's coming to avoid most of it and thanks to the fuse induced time limit you cannot ever take it slowly. If avoiding everything in your path isn't a big enough problem the game insists that you grab the various party balloons floating around the levels to locate four spheres with card suit symbols on them  heart, spade, club and diamond  if you wish to progress to the next level; failure to find them all will result in being you being sent back to the start of the level to retrieve what you've missed.

The graphics may be beautiful, if a little too close-up; but the sound on the other hand has some problems. While the music does indeed fit the jolly and bouncing nature of the game's clown theme, it loops far too quickly and quickly becomes monotonous, otherwise the sound is pretty sparse and forgettable, mostly consisting of muffled explosions, Kid's yelps of pain, or the things that cause said pain as they fly onto the screen.

Along the way you can collect coins to allow you to play bonus stages and HP icons to restore your health, both of which you will need as you're health doesn't regenerate between levels. In fact if you're really low on the end of a level and you didn't get any bonus stage health then, depending on the level, you could even find yourself dieing before you even start as certain levels take off a potion of health as Kid crashes into them before you even get control; which needless to say feels severely unfair.

Thankfully the controls are nice and simple: pressing up slows Kid down, likewise pressing down speeds him up, left and right go their retrospective directions and every other button makes him jump. If this isn't enough, then several other control options are offered of varying usefulness, including one in which you hold the joy pad up-side down? The downside of the controls is that in general they feel a little sluggish some of the time, which, on top of the nature of the game, can cause the player to lose energy unnecessarily.

If you can be bothered to seek them out, there are a number of secret bonus sections on each level; which offer up power-ups and a collection of coins. However finding these sections is more down to luck than skill. For example who is suppose to figure out that the way to get to one is to stand on a cannon and jump in the air, or that another is entered by falling into a soda can, the very things that you are trying to avoid.

Whilst it may have an original twist to call its own and has some great cartoon graphics, Kid Klown in Crazy Chase is probably a game best left in the past. Because although it may be amusing for a while, it's frustrating tendencies, awkward level layout and the mandatory nature of level completion does not earn it many - or indeed any - accolades, or indeed a real reason why someone should try to hunt a copy of the game down.

King Arthur's World is a 1993 side-scrolling strategy game for the Super NES. It was developed by Argonaut Games and published by Jaleco.

In the game, the player controls King Arthur. At the start of each level, only the King is present, but various types of troops can be brought out of the tent where he starts. The King and his troops can be commanded to move in a direction, which they do until they receive new orders, are killed or come across enemy troops, which they fight if they can. Also, some troops have special commands, such as for archers to fire arrows.

The aim of each level is to proceed from the tent at the start, to the finishing point. This may require the player to defeat various enemies, avoid traps and obstacles. King Arthur is the only essential character. If he dies, the player has failed, and play can only continue if 100 gold coins are spent to rescue him, in which case the player restarts at his/her tent.

The game can be played with the SNES control pad or, alternatively, with the SNES Mouse, as it is one of the few third-party games that support the device.

King of Demons is a sweet SNES platformer that was released late in the systems life.

You take the role of a man named Abel, who's wife and daughter were kidnapped by your supposed best friend, Bayer. Typically, victims of kidnapping face a grim fate, but even more so in this case. It seems a demon needed some resurrecting (And not just any demon, mind you. The KING of demons!), and your family was just what was needed to accomplish this. Abel doesn't like this very much, so he takes his lucky handgun on a quest of love and vengeance.

The gameplay is pretty good: Think of a mix of Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts and Castlevania. Abel can double jump, slide, stomp, and shoot a semiautomatic pistol (Which can also be charged). You can also get a familiar ala Symphony of the Night that will attack your enemies and resurrect you if you die, which just happens to be your dead wifes soul in the form of a mutated looking fairy (?!). Also, after each boss fight, you can pick up a crystal that will transform you into one of three forms: A red creature that has really fast attacks, a green demon that has more power and less speed, and a blue dragon that's really big and slow but very powerful.

Graphically, the game is good, with an art style that reminds me of Blackthorne. A game this dark in nature really needs decent graphics to convey the proper atmosphere (Remember Monster Party? Good game, but about as scary as the Teletubbies. Oh, wait..), and it doesn't fail in that aspect. The music and sound effects are alright, but nothing really memorable.

Overall, if you like games with a dark atmosphere, or even platformers in general, you should like this game.

Translation Description

The translation is really good, with no errors and good grammar. The new title screen is nice as well.

"A game that redifines the term"

Let's face it gamers Capcom's Darkstalkers series was aimed more toward the classic Universal monsters from the 30s like Frankenstein,the Wolfman,and the creature from the black lagoon(Their DS counterparts are Demitri,J.Tablin,and Rikyo). While SNK's King of the Monster games on the other hand(which came out sometime before Darkstakers) was more toward the big rubber suit monsters that would wreck a small toy town like Godzilla,King Kong,and Mothura. Well that is what you do here short of. King of the Monsters is based on the arcade game of the same name and in here two monsters duke it out in a wrestling type game with bear hugs and pile drivers while at the same time you are causing havoc on various Japanese cities. Apparently SNK pulled a Final Fight on this game and made the SNES version somewhat lacking compared to its arcade brother. 

Well some of the changes here are that two players can't go face two other monsters(That sucks) and two of the characters have been taken out and they are the slimey creature Poison Ghost(That guy looked like he was slimed one too many times on Nickelodean)and the King Kong rip off Woo(He made it into KotM2 which was also on the SNES but by then he was turned into a robot called Cyber Woo). Well the remaining characters are Geon the Godzilla knock off,Astro Guy who looks like a combination of Ultra Man and Captain America,the big stone fighter named Rocky who has no relation to a certain flying sqruiel,and the big mutated beetle Beetle Mania(Lord only knows what would happen if this guy was called Beatle Mania). Well you fight 8 opponents here but you are going to fight all 4 monsters twice but since there are only 4 characters I guess that is excusable. While the game looks like a fighting game it kind of isn't and is more like a wrestling game. So let us march on down to the review.

Graphics
The cities all look good and include some Japanese landmarks like the Tokyo Tower. There are some vehicles that will stop you like tanks and jets and they are also done good. Well now on to the monsters and they look swell and once you think about it some of the monsters look like guys in rubber suits(That's a good thing though since it fits well with the atmosphere and gives it that Godzilla movie feel). Well they did a nice job.

Gameplay
Each character has a projectile that fits his character(Rocky shoots out rocks and Geon breathes fire) and there is a host of wrestling moves like piledrivers,bear hugs,suplexs,etc also you pick up tanks and the like to use for your advantage. Each stage has a red tape at two ends of the level and you can't go beyond that and if you do you will get a small amount of damage. Fighting the CPU is fun and cool and with added addition of destroying stuff it makes thing more even more fun. If your opponent's life runs out and he is knocked down then you will have to pin him first before he gets up and you will be called the victor(Gives it a kind of wrestling feel). The game is just simple fun.

Sound
The monsters would make this yell of victory whenever they win and that was I think the only voices present here. The sound effects include the sound whenever you hit the ground,usual hitting sound effects,and the continuous sound of buildings being crumbled. The music was okay but not great but it did fit the game's theme. Sound could make room for improvement but it will do for now.

Control
The control includes a jump button,a punch button,and a kick button and you can also get up close to your foe and the two of you will struggle to get to see who will be the one to do a grabble. Doing throws and stuff like that is kind of hard to do because there are so many that you will end up doing a random one at times if you don't know the commands. Trying to pin an opponent at the end of a match is a real pain because you may end up missing but that is kind of minor. Control is good overall.

Replay
This game is just simple little fun that will get your attention for some time and the ending that you get is hilarious even if it is the same one for all the character but you really have to see it because I cracked up during it. If they added in the two missing characters Poison Ghost,and Woo then things would have been better but as it stands the replay value is on the good side.

Final Word
A good game that didn't get much credit. If you happen to be both a wrestling fan and a Japanese monster movie lover then hey buddy this might be the perfect game for you. Not convinced yet then go rent it and see it you like it or not. King of the Monster is a very good game and it provides lots of fun so there you have it. Hmmm you know after writing this while I'am at it I'll go play it some more Hee Hee(Rushes to SNES and plugs this game in).

"A monster fighting a large, topless alien in Paris? Sounds exciting..."

Most monsters are fun to play with and fun to look at. They're also fun to touch and smell. In addition to all that, they can do also lots of cool stuff for you, like help you save up for your parents' anniversary gift, arrest criminals, or in this case, save the world. Don't get the wrong idea, these beasts are basically just saving the world to become King of the Monsters. Unfortunately, the road to royalty is filled with a lot of crap that gets in your way, and there's some big red timer at the top of the screen that has the power to murder you if you're unable to reach your destination before it reaches its own: ZERO!!!

GRAW!
Look out, kids! There are three playable characters in this game, and they're all horrible monsters which you wouldn't want to invite to dinner, because they'd become angry at your puny human food and kill your dog. One of these ''monsters'' that I'm talking about is Astro Guy or Atomic Man or something stupid like that. He's a really huge guy in a flaming orange suit who likes to make provocative poses. I know you're already dying to play this game, but just stick with me for a moment, while I tell you a little more about why I hate this game.

Another monster is Super Geon. He's like Geon from the first King of the Monsters, only this time he's Super because Atomic Guy beat the hell out of him. In case you don't know what Geon looks like, he's a green lizard. Kind of like that guy who sells Geico Auto Insurance, only bigger and slightly more ambitious.

The third monster is my favorite, because he's a big robot. A big robot named Cyber Woo. Seriously, how cool is that? He's also yellow. So, would you rather play as a green lizard, orange man, or a yellow robot. . . . Yellow Robot . . . or no yellow robot . . . hmm.

Now that you know what the characters are, I'm sure you're just aching to know how the game is played. There's a punch, a kick, a jump, a block, and a charge button. Charging doesn't do anything unless you get your meter all the way up, then you get to shoot a projectile and do a little bit of damage to an enemy. The game plays kind of like final fight, in that you walk through a level in a one- or two-player mode and beat up a bunch of stupid little aliens. Okay, so there weren't too many aliens in Final Fight, but you get the idea. Another different thing about this game is that picking up a ''P'' item will change the color of your monster, as well as power him up. The color changes include Super Geon's Baby-Blue and Cyber Woo's Tang-Orange. The levels in this game don't last very long at all, and neither does the timer. Fortunately, it resets once you get to a boss, but it's not like it really matters, because you're going to die anyway. 

On the subject of death, I'd like to note that the animations for when your character loses a life are somewhat humorous. Geon melts, Atomic Guy turns into a skeleton, and Woo falls apart. And he's a robot.

The boss fights can't really be described without somehow mentioning the facts that they're boring and that they suck. That's not a good thing, considering the fact that basically the whole game is about the boss fights. Whenever the enemy hits you, you'll fall down and have to mash the 'A' button in order to get back up. The lovely people who designed this game were nice enough to tell the player to do this every time it happens. Another fantastic thing you'll have to do in the game is tap left and right on your d-pad whenever you get caught in a grapple with the enemy monster. Not only does this kill your thumb and directional pad, but the winner also seems to be completely random, unless you don't press anything. In that case you just get your ass beaten in. This attack is also pretty much necessary to beat the enemy in time because the normal attacks will just get you killed quickly.

Like I said, there's not much more to the game than the boss fights, except a crappy VS mode where you can beat up your friend. Or start beating him/her up, then quit because it's really boring, just like the main game. I wouldn't despise it so much if the ''normal'' enemies didn't take only one hit to kill. One very difficult-to-land hit. Why is it so hard to hit these enemies? Well, they fly all over the place and your attack animation only has one frame, and there's something like a two-second pause after you strike. That's not good for you.

The sound is pretty bland too. You get monster screams, building crashes, and explosions, none of which sound very spectacular. There's some music in there, but I hardly noticed it because the hate bubbles in my brain were bubbling too loud. I think I liked the boss music the first time I played it, but I was an idiot back then and loved all things monster-related.

Okay, I've been blabbing about the crappy monsters and gameplay long enough. What's the story behind this video game? Well, apparently there're some aliens out to conquer Earth and, as a resident monster of earth, it's your job to prevent those aliens from taking the planet. The silly little humans don't seem to care about the alien threat, but they are nice enough to provide the monsters with power-ups and power-downs. One of the more exciting points of the story is the fact that there are two, count 'em, two endings. Isn't that fantastic?

The End
So, that's pretty much all I have to say about the game. Would I recommend purchasing it? I wouldn't put it on my ''must-have'' list, but you can probably get it cheaper than any other available side-scrolling beat 'em up, so why the hell not? It's below average, but it's a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Involving Monsters. Yeah.

Spring Breeze

That awful King Dedede is at it again. He's stolen all the food in Dream Land! The inhabitants don't like being hungry and have asked Kirby to help. The new adventure begins.

Dyna Blade

A strange bird, named Dyna Blade, has come from the mountain and ruined the crops! Unless Kirby can stop him, Dream Land will be devastated!

Revenge of Meta Knight

One of Kirby's old foes, Meta Knight, has built a giant ship and is planning top conquer Dream Land! It's up to Kirby to destroy the ship, defeat Meta Knight, and save Dream Land. Good luck, Kirby!

--From the SNES Kirby Super Star instruction manual.

Overview:

Super Star was a pretty good addition to the Kirby series. They put a lot of Kirby games into one. My personal favorite was the Samurai Kirby game. There were about eight games to choose from in all. Some were one-on-one fighters and some were adventures. All of them were pretty fun. I liked the graphics in Kirby's Superstar. They looked very good, with nice cartoony animation and an excellent color palette. This is a great game for one player or two. You and a friend could battle each other or help each other on a quest. Or, you could battle against the computer or take on the quest by yourself.

The controls were responsive and easy to use: there is an optional tutorial before each game. The gameplay is great because of all the variety. The story is pretty good on the platformer. The other games don't really have a story. This was one of the better Kirby games because it had a little something for everybody. A definite must-play!

Directions:

When you start one of the games, it will ask you if you've played it before. If you answer no, it will give you a tutorial. Pick your game, and compete against your friends, or try to beat the computer while getting the highest score possible.

Spring breeze is a side-scrolling platformer like most Kirby games.


Dyna-Blade is another side-scrolling platformer with a few more levels. Gourmet Race is controlled the same as the first two, but it's a race to the end of the course. The Great Cave Offensive is controlled the same way, but you don't change levels. It's one big cave where you have to find all the treasures to win. Revenge of Meta Knight is played the same as the other platformers, except for the time limit, and there are a lot of cut-scenes. Milkyway Wishes is the similar, but you don't gain abilities by swallowing your enemies. You must gain them at certain parts in the game, then you will have them permanently. You can change the one you're using by pressing Start and choosing the desired power. The Megaton Punch game is all about timing. All you have to do is stop the power and accuracy meters at the right time to deliver the strongest megaton punch you can. Your punch has to be better than your opponent's to advance to the next match. 

Samurai Kirby is a face-off between you and an opponent, in which you have to have a faster reaction time than your enemy. You will be paired with an enemy and the you have to press any button as soon as you see the paper with Japanese writing on it. If you pressed it faster than your opponent, your character will beat his, but if he pressed the button faster than you, then you will be defeated.

Controls:

The controls vary from game to game. See the in-game tutorials.

Hints:

Secret Level in Milky Way Wishes

On the level select screen in Milky Way Wishes, move Kirby to the green star between Cavios and Skyhigh, and then enter the level. Here you can find the Copy ability.

Tips:

Unlockables

Arena 
Beat all previous stages

Milky Way Wishes 
Beat Great Cave Offensive and Revenge of Meta-Knight

Revenge of Meta-Knight 
Beat DynaBlade

Sound Test 
Beat the Arena

Secret Level in Milky Way Wishes
On the level select screen in Milky Way Wishes, move kirby to the green star between Cavios and Skyhigh, and then enter the level. Here you can find the Copy ability.

Reduced damage
Pause game play in any level except for 'Milky Way Wishes' and quickly press L, R(2), L, X, A. The majority of opponent attacks will now be half as effective.

Cameos
If you use the Stone ability enough, you may turn into a statue of Samus, or a golden statue of Mario. In Megaton Punch, if you look in the background, you'll see Mario, Luigi, and a few other people from the older Mario games.

Kirby's Avalanche
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Puzzle
Players: 2
_________________________
*
The First Annual Dream Land's Avalanche Competition is about to get under way, and as Kirby and a host of characters from the Kirby series, you can join the tournament and become Avalanche king.

Avalanche is similar to Puyo Puyo, and has you stacking colored blobs similar in a way to Tetris. When a certain amount of one color is stacked, an explosion occurs and the screen clears of those blobs, which then appear in the other players screen (either the CPU or a second player). When your screen is cleared before the other player, you move onto the next round, and so on until the final boss. The winner of that match is then crowned the Avalanche king.

Tips:

Custom Mode
During the game Hold down A + B + X + Y on controller 2 and then reset the game. When you get to the main menu
go into the Options screen and a new Custom Menu should appear.

Once upon a time, on a little star, there was a small, peaceful country called Dream Land. The Dream Spring incident was over and the inhabitants of Dream Land returned to their normal, peaceful lives. Every day, they would eat delicious meals and take wonderful afternoon naps. There was no need to worry about anything since everything was so peaceful.

One night, the inhabitants said to one another, "Let's gaze at the star-lit sky and have wonderful dreams tonight." However, when they gazed up into the sky they noticed something was different. The sky was black. There wasn't a single star in sight! Everyone became upset and asked each other "What happened to the stars?" "Will we ever see them again?" Then, someone said, "Don't worry! Surely, the sky will be full of stars again!" However, the stars did not return that night, or the night after. Everyone in Dream Land became very sad.

Another dark, gloomy night loomed over Dream Land. All sorts of rumors had been spreading, and everyone was saying, "It looks like King Dedede is behind this." "I bet he's hogging all those beautiful stars for himself!"

If it's true, there's only one hero that can save the stars. Yes, that young hero is Kirby. He comes in with the spring breeze and saves Dream Land in times of crisis.

Kirby heads for King Dedede's floating castle. The king has set up many traps in his castle. His servants each have a star and they wait for Kirby's arrival at the castle.

This adventure is full of new and amazing challenges. Good luck, Kirby!

--From the SNES Kirby's Dream Course instruction manual.

Overview:

Kirby's Dream Course is a golf-type game, but it is anything but typical. It combines aspects of golf with aspects of classic Kirby game play, for a very interesting and unique experience. There are eight standard courses, with eight 'holes' each, plus several bonus courses. Using Kirby as a ball, knock out the enemies, then sink Kirby into the cup to complete each hole. Sounds simple, right? Well, it's more difficult than you might think.

I like the sound effects. It sounds like you're stretching Kirby to his limit and then THWAP! letting him go! Makes me giggle on the inside. The graphics are pretty good. At least the courses are clear and easily maneuvered, since it's obvious what you should and shouldn't hit (except in the case of the floating black puffer fish guys, they aren't baddies and you'll lose a tomato if you bump one). Also, it's worth it to play this game just to watch Kirby's victory dance when he gets his medals. Whoa he's squishy!

Directions:

Guide Kirby through the course to destroy the baddies and release the star they have. The last baddie turns into the cup you have to sink Kirby in. If you get a hole in one, you get an extra man. You start the game with 2 men and you lose one whenever you fall off the course or lose all your tomatoes.

You start the game with 4 tomatoes and you lose one of these whenever you take a shot or Kirby gets hurt. You gain a tomato whenever Kirby kills a baddie or goes in the cup.

The game has a demo that is very helpful, and, while I will try to explain as well, I recommend going through the demo. Seeing it in action helps.

Spin: You can put a spin on Kirby by holding down B and pressing left or right. This will cause Kirby to curve, allowing you to knock out baddies around obstacles. When doing a fly shot you can also put forward or back spin on Kirby. Do this by selecting a fly shot (press up) then hold down B and press up or down. When you go to take the shot (by pressing A) there will be a green cursor that moves up and down the center vertical bar. Press A when the green cursor meets the white one you set to get the same shot that the dotted lines showed you (you must also hit the ball full strength to get the same path as the line). Forward spin will make Kirby go further after he lands and back spin will stop him and even reverse his direction.
On Shots: Fly shots will get you over gaps and over some obstacles. Pressing A at the right moment will give Kirby a boost. This works best when you need extra height on a bounce off a fly shot. On ground shots, it tends to only shorten your shot. Either way, boosting will alter your shot.
Course Particulars: "Yes Jim, it does look like Kirby has hit this one directly into the spike trap! Oooo, that's gotta hurt!" Different courses will have different traps and special squares. Warps warp, and spikes spike. They are pretty obvious mostly. (O.K. so the trampoline is hard to guess. It's a blue lined rectangle with white lines running across it width-wise.) Not so obvious is that you can destroy some obstacles, like the tree, with certain abilities.
Abilities: You can gain abilities that will allow Kirby to do things he normally can't by pressing B while Kirby is moving. The ability you get depends on which baddie you kill (the flashy ones have the powers). The sparky guy gives you the ability to pass under storm clouds unharmed and to destroy trees. You will exchange a current ability with the new one if you kill a new baddie with a new ability. Dying loses you that ability.
Two Players: *NOT IN DEMO* When you play against your friends, you alternate turns with them. Whenever either of you gets into the cup you both will advance to the next hole. In 2 player mode, the player who gets the most stars wins. Get stars by defeating baddies or stealing the stars of the baddies your friend has killed, but beware, they can steal them back, too. You also have energy instead of tomatoes and lives. When you lose all of your energy Kirby goes to sleep and your friend gets to take two turns. You lose energy when Kirby gets hurt or if he goes over the edge. If you crash into each other you will lose energy as well (kamikaze Kirby.... could be a useful strategy...). Also when you bump into each other you will trade your current abilities. Roll over a moon and sun square to swap you and your friend's star points for this level. OOooO dirty! 

Controls:

A Button - Shoot Kirby, Give Kirby an Extra Boost
B Button - Hold and Press Left or Right to Add Spin
X Button - N/A
Y Button - Hold and Press D-pad To Scroll Map
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Look at Score Cards
Up - Fly Shot
Down - Ground Shot
L Button - Move Guideline 45 Degrees
R Button - Move Guideline 45 Degrees
Left and Right - Move Guideline 1 Degree

Hints:

PERFECT!
Sometimes you just have to smash the mess outta Kirby. When you shoot him at full strength (the power meter turns pink) he will take the same course as the guideline showed. Hard to pull off, but sometimes just exactly what you need to finish a hole with a hole in one.

Tips:

Medal Rewards
1-Player Extra Courses 
Get a Silver or Gold medal on every normal Course

2-Player Extra Courses 
Get any medal on every normal Course

Map Select for Extra courses 
Get Gold medals in every Extra course

Map Select for Normal courses 
Get Silver or Gold medals in every Extra course

Sound Test 
Get any medal on every Extra Course

Gaining extra lives
To gain an extra life, you must make a Hole in One on any level. It's usually pretty tough to do, but the
extra lives come in handy late in the game!

Name Change
To change your name without restarting the game, go to the member screen and highlight the file to be changed.
Press L, R, and A at the same time to get to the Name Entry Screen.

Sound Room and Dance Select
If you complete all EXTRA courses with a silver or gold medal (you have to have already completed all regular
courses with a silver or gold medal) two new items will appear on the main menu: Sound Room and Dance Select. Sound Room gives you a classic sound test screen where you can hear all 125 effects and 31 music tracks. Dance Select lets you view any of the kirby dances that happen at the end of each single and 2-player round.

_________________________

Kirby, our hero, makes his home in Dream Land, which is located on PopStar. PopStar is a small, peaceful planet at the edge of a vast universe.

One day, Kirby and Gooey went fishing. Birds were singing. The sun was shining. It was such a nice day that they felt more like napping than fishing.

As Kirby and Gooey relaxed, they noticed a black, cloud-like object appear in the PopStar sky!

The black object started to spit out small clouds. These clouds were scattered everywhere.

Just then, Coo appeared, looking panicked. "Hurry, Kirby!" he said. "PopStar's in BIG trouble!"

The small clouds took control of King Dedede and his minions. They started to do terrible things!

Now, Kirby and his friends have left to get rid of these strange clouds and save PopStar!

--From the SNES Kirby's Dream Land 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

The lovable little pink vacuum is back, in this crazy adventure through Dreamland. King Dedede is back once again to try and take over Dreamland and turn it into a nightmare. Now Kirby and his friend Gooey must jump, fly, and swim around in the five stages of Dreamland until you get to King Dedede himself. It's up to you to save your home. Good Luck!

Kirby's Dreamland 3 is the last installment for SNES featuring this cute little guy, and the first Kirby game to offer a two player mode. The graphics are better with more realistic (for the genre) images and a scrolling background. The music for this game keeps with the classic Kirby soundtrack but done over to make it sound better. This game is the finest Kirby for the SNES, so get to playing and have fun.

Directions:

Play as Kirby (or as Kirby and Gooey for 2 player mode) to save your home in Dreamland from the evil King Dedede who wishes Dreamland to become a nightmare. Now the only hope for the residents of Dreamland is Kirby and his friend Gooey. Don't let that get you down, you still get help from six of your friends. Among them is Rico the raccoon, Coo the owl, your girlfriend Chuchu, Pitch the bird, and Kine the fish. Fight through the five areas of Dreamland (each with six levels) and face the bosses. Among them is Whispy Woods the Tree, Acro the fish, Don and Con the bomb brothers, Ado the painter, and King Dedede. Watch your health, which is on the bottom of the screen, and keep it up with the vials of health and the strawberries. After tens hits you die and use one of you four lives. Get powers by sucking in and swallowing enemies, however only certain enemies give you powers. Among the powers are Fire, electricity, the umbrella, and the boomerang. 

Also, don't forget to collect stars because once you get ten full stars you get an extra life. So good luck, player: Go and save Dreamland!

Genre: Beat 'em Up , Side-Scrolling
Release Year: 2004
Players: 2
Original Title: Kouryuu no Mimi
Translated By: RPGONE
Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
Koryu no Mimi is a side-scrolling beat-em-up somewhat in the same vein as Final Fight. As Final Fight clones go, though, it seems pretty good. For one thing, the storyline is a lot more involved, with lots of different allies and villains running around. There are a lot of moves and combos you can pull off, and you also get plenty of weapons to wield, scenery to throw around, and so on. And if you can fill up your mimi-meter (or whatever) to wield the power of your Ring of the Golden Dragon's Ear, not only can you heal some of your damage, but you also briefly harness the power of the Dragon or something to become faster and more powerful. Neat!

Translation Description:

The translation is complete! BugCatcher's translation, despite the occasional typo, reads quite well and even features judicious use of semicolons. Jonny's hacking looks nice and clean, and the variable-width font accomplished by ChrisRPG lets the story shine. See? Just relax and play.

You may also wish to visit the RPGOne website (or more specifically, the game's downloads page) for other resources such as move lists, cheat files, and so on.

Kunio Kun Dodgeball
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Dodgeball
Release Year: 2004
Original Title: Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball: Zenin Shuugou!
Translated By: Azelistic
Version: 1.00
_________________________
*
Dodgeball, the epitome of classroom sports, is magnificently portrayed in this wonderful game.

Or not.

Kunio Kun's Dodgeball is a sequel to the original NES and Arcade versions of Super Dodge Ball, and a prequel to Super Dodge Ball on the SNK Neo-Geo arcade system; and while those three versions were straight-to-the-point dodgeball games, this version is a bit more simulator-ish. Here, you have to either create a team using Kunio and his classmates [Riki and Todd Thornley from Crash N' The Boys, to name a few], before taking on the world. The good news: The graphics are really good. The bad news: The controls are absolutely horrid.

The game is very straightforward, but at the same time it is impossible to play without a menu translation. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to get to a match without being able to, and quit in frustration (one of the patches hosted here fixed that though). You have to build your team before taking on the world, and depending on your performance you can buy upgrades and special moves for your team. The game saves everything to a battery backup so you don't have to write 64-character passwords. And that is it for the simulation part of the game.

Once you get to the court, the game goes downhill fast. The game skips frames a lot, it's hard for you to get your character to run, the special moves are a pain to pull off, and you can't change the character you use quickly enough. And to top things off, you have to press Y+B at the same time to jump. What the hell? The system had six buttons! A and X aren't even used at all, why didn't they map jump and special moves to them?

While the graphics are good, sometimes the stages get in the way. For example, the Japan stage doesn't have a solid floor, but a semi-transparent net. It makes it hard to see your characters at times. Other stages, like the US, don't suffer from this problem. The music and sound effects serve their purpose. They're good but won't win any awards.

You'll take a lot of time to get used to the control? if you aren't disgusted with the game already. Technos has done much better in the past. Good thing they didn't make many sports games?

Translation Description:

I used to hate this game? because I never managed to find a way to get into a match. I used to go through menu screen after menu screen, not being able to figure out how to beat up people.

Then, Azel released this patch. And all was well.

The only really distracting thing here is the font? he used two letters in one 8-8 tile so some words would fit in the small space on the screen, and therefore makes the text look really strange. And everything's in uppercase. The font does get the point across and it does not distract that much once you get used to it. And Azel worked on everything (translation and hacking) on his own, so props to him.

Azel did wish us to mention that as of this writing, the game has issues with ZSNES that can cause it to lock up, especially after performing a special shot. So use SNES9X, 'mkay? Neither The Whirlpool nor Azel can be held responsible for lockups in the ZSNES emulator.

Also, read the manual. It's big and scary, but that generally means there's important information in it. So read it!

Kyle Petty's No Fear Racing
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Racing , Cars
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Williams Entertainment
Publisher: Midway
_________________________

Kyle Petty's No Fear Racing is a stock car racing game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that is loosely based on the NASCAR fixture that draws in fans from February to November. There is a two player mode but it must be activated in the options menu of the game. This mode allows two players to compete against each other using a split screen. The two player mode allows equal opportunities towards teamwork and competition in the single race mode as well as in the season mode.[1] Players can either race on season mode or exhibition mode.

When the players have mastered all the factory-made courses, it is possible to create an original race course with as many turns and straight sections that memory limitations will allow. Custom decals can also be placed on the course as a way to personalize a course; this can be done to an extent that no two courses will look exactly the same twice in a row. After building the layout of the track, the player can choose to choose a song that will play when they race on their customized track (provided that the music is activated in the options menu). World Grand Prix was one of the first games to have this feature (without custom decals).

Rarely used in other racing games, it allows players to re-create their favorite race tracks to the best of their ability. The object in the game is to get as to close to first place as possible by the end of the race. Practice is also necessary if the player wants to start at the pole position. During the season mode, the player must score points in order to remain in the competition. If he or she fails to do this, then the game immediately ends with no other recourse other than to use passwords to restore a saved game. Even though the cars move slower than today's vehicles (Dodge Charger, Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Impala SS) and use a smaller rear spoiler, defeating Kyle Petty and winning the NASCAR championship is still a challenge for fantasy race car drivers.

Censorship:

In both versions, licensing for the Winston Cup (now called the Sprint Cup) does not exist. This is because federal laws (in addition to Nintendo censorship) prevent tobacco and alcohol references from being placed in any computer or video game. However, the words Havoline, No Fear, Kyle Petty, and "racing" can by viewed in the main menu as the words scroll rapidly across the screen from the left to the right. This special effect is only seen in the North American version of the game, and these sponsors were permitted because they did not sell alcohol or tobacco-related products.

There is an unsponsored black car with Petty's number 42 on the game's cover. In reality, it's his Mello Yello car he drove from 1991-1994, minus the drink's decals on the car. There isn't any official reason as to why the Mello Yello car was not in the game. One could guess they did not receive permission from Mello Yello or the Coca-Cola Company. Another possible reason could be that because the game was released during the 1995 NASCAR Winston Cup season. During that time, Kyle's car had changed over to blue and pink colors with Coors Light as a sponsor. The developers could have probably not wanted to even hint that the driver who is on their game was driving a car with alcohol as a sponsor.

The Lagoon Story Goes:

The story takes place in Lakeland, a wealthy country filled with people that love their families. Everything was going well until the people of Lakeland noticed they had a bit of a water problem. As it turns out, a being known as Zerah polluted all the lakes and rivers in Lakeland. A lot of people became ill and some of them were dying. Zerah has done this in an attempt to release an evil spirit that is hiding beneath Lagoon Castle. He has also lifted Lagoon Castle into the clouds so no one can reach it. In the midst of this, the country needs a hero! Who better to answer this call than, Nasir, the Champion of Light? It will be your quest to go through unknown lands fraught with peril. You will encounter demons and monsters along the way. There will also be riddles to figure out, and information to gather. Before the end, you must defeat Zerah and bring peace to the land. Good luck!

Directions:

Lagoon is a lot of fun to play. It's kind of a mix between an adventure and an RPG. It's got a few RPG elements, but it isn't round based combat. It is pretty tough to beat. It would take a good while. It's a little confusing at first, because you have to buy your weapons at the armor shop, not the weapons shop. It would seem that the Japanese translators were confused about the definitions of armor and weapons. Lagoon is a great game. What are you waiting for? Go play! 

Controls:

A Button - Jump, Access subscreens
B Button - Attack

Hints:

Recover Life and Magic
You will notice you take damage, but if you stand still, you will slowly recover HP. This also applies when using magic. Use this to your advantage. This will not work in boss fights, though.

The objective of the game is to become the undisputed champion of illegal races in the U.S.A.. To do so, the player must race against a group of computer controlled opponents in a variety of illegal races across the country. The races are divided into three leagues, each one with increasingly harder opponents, and the player needs to regularly upgrade his Lamborghini Diablo in order to keep him above the rest of drivers, by using the money from bets as well as the bonuses obtained when finishing races in the first place.

The races themselves take place in a variety of scenarios (mountain roads, the desert, urban settings) and they include weather conditions such as rain and snow. At the end of each league, and in order to be able to join the next one, the player has to go through a "challenge", consisting of a timed race in a highway infested with trucks.

Despite the game obtaining mostly positive reviews, a major source of complaints came from the saving system. Players are allowed to save their progress once every four races. Since the game requires the player to always finish in first place in order to progress further into the game, this means players needed to win four races in a row before saving their progress.

The Super NES version supports the SNES Mouse and Super Scope. When the game is played with either accessory, the player can access a different game mode in which it is possible to destroy the opponent by shooting them (the original bet mode is not present). The infamous saving system from computer versions is also substituted by a password system.

Unlike many such adaptations, the game closely follows the plot and scenery of the movie. The game, like the movie, was not received with much enthusiasm from the public. In fact, all versions of the game faced an even poorer reception than the film, receiving mostly negative reviews.

Tips:

Energy refill
On the first level, go right until you reach the first police car. Hit its tail light 20 times and you should hear an explosion and gain 5000 points.  You can then refill your energy bar at any time by pressing and holding the R button.

What is a Lemming?

Lemmings are actually very small rodents that live in Northern Europe. Every so many years an unusual event happens: The Lemmings population explodes and grows to immense proportions. At this time, the multitudes travel across vast spaces of land oblivious to any danger that may confront them. The Lemmings' only concern is to migrate forward, each following the next. Where are they going you ask? In an almost hypnotic state, they plunge, by the thousands, mindlessly into the sea towards certain annihilation.

This is your chance to play a part in a natural phenomenon and possibly help solve a puzzle which has baffled researchers for years.

Our Definition

lem-ming (lem-ing): adorable yet incredibly stupid furry creatures, lost in a maze of confusion. Known for walking off cliffs, wandering aimlessly into dangerous passageways and drowning by the thousands in small pools of water. Without your help, they have no chance for survival.

Let's Go!

Lemmings may be mindless but are luckily equipped with special skills that you must assign to them so that they can travel safely through many dangerous terrains. An experienced player will know precisely where and when to assign these skills to the token Lemmings who will build a safe path towards an exit and save the rest of their buddies. Your success is measured by the percentage you save.

It will take all your brain power to rescue as many Lemmings as possible from impending doom! As you see hordes of these cute little fellows march to their sad fate, a guilty conscience is not the only thing you will develop--it's sure to become an addictive obsession!

--From the SNES Lemmings instruction manual.

Overview:

Lemmings are suicidal little fuzzy creatures. Their complete life's ambition seems to be finding a cliff to walk off. This is certainly their last life's ambition, because once they find one, they walk right off.

Anyway, in Lemmings the game, your job is to save them from themselves. Using their various skills, guide them over and around obstacles and through the exit door, before time runs out and before they all walk off somewhere you don't want them to, i.e. to their doom.

I couldn't figure out how to get out of the first little area (though granted, I didn't dwell on it), so I checked out a GameFAQs review for Lennus II. This guy (who obviously didn't know Japanese) blasted the game for having no story, sub-NES-quality graphics, the worst music he's ever heard, and gameplay that was eclipsed by that in Final Fantasy II and III. What the fuck game was he playing? See kids, this is why retards shouldn't be allowed to play Squaresoft games.

Maybe he was playing the first Lennus, which was released here as Paladin's Quest and, admittedly, is all of those above things. Lennus II kicks things up by several notches, but is essentially the same Lufia/Phantasy Star-esque gameplay. But I mean, look at those graphics! They totally rock. GameFAQs is stupid.

Translation Description:

Bongo' from Stealth Translations gave Magic Destiny a kick in the pants to put this project back together and finish it up after years of dormancy. The result is a completed English Lennus II translation.

Wildbill obviously spent a lot of time on the readme with a partial original game manual translation, history of the project, and of course instructions on how to patch the game. The same work and care went into this translation. The amount of people who had a helping hand in this project and the way it came together to be finished is a proud display of our community at it's best. Well, go download the patch already!

In the beginning, a typical teenage boy name Lester, who is "kind of geeky" and "kind of sleepy" recently got a new issue of the Super Duper Hero Squad. He reads it while walking on a dock, until he fell asleep next to a cargo crate laying beside a cargo ship. After he and the cargo were loaded onto the ship by a crane and cruised off, the ship got hijacked by pirates. Lester luckily found a life jacket and swam toward the most adjacent island while the cargo ship sank. Lester must find his way home by exploring the island for someone or something that can help him survive.

Gameplay:

The game has a unique engine in which the protagonist, Lester, is easily frightened early in the game and will act reluctantly when faced with animals, heights, etc. For instance, when the player guides Lester towards a crab in the first stage, he will at first scream and run in the opposite direction; when the player makes him walk towards it a second time he will slowly creep towards it. This coincides with one of the major themes of the game being Lester facing his fears, and these instances happen less and less as the game goes on.

Also notable are the game's rotoscoped graphics; humorously referred to in the game's manual as "Filmed in Geek-O-Vision." The manual boasts that the Lester character has over 250 frames of animation, "about twice the number of an average game."

"I feel lucky."

I'll read you your rights after I shoot you in the gut.

In the police world of "Good cop, Bad cop," nobody ever wants to be the good cop. The family man that shows up to work in a suit, badge, and never shoots until fired upon is a dying breed. Instead, our cheers and hopes are directed at the criminal with the badge: the man who shows up on the scene with a pair of shades and a magnum larger than our heads. You'll find no Miranda rights and donut boxes here.

By some clerical error, we lucky SNES owners have been given this magnum. Sure, it may be bright blue, have "Konami" written on the side, and connect to our console with a wire, but damn it, we get to play the bad cop. Despite the age of the title, Lethal Enforcers shoots any pretenders to the throne with a .38 slug. Many have tried; many have failed to deliver the thrills of fighting the criminal underworld one bullet at a time.

Piece be with you.

Lethal Enforcers comes packaged with the bad cop's weapon of choice, a big ass revolver. Despite the clear aesthetics of the controller, the accuracy is on par with the arcade version and puts the SNES "super scope" to shame. This translates to a gameplay experience with control as good as your aim, perhaps to the disparagement of shaky-handed gamers. After six rounds are expended from the default revolver, you must shoot off the screen to reload your gun, a masterful touch we've all grown to love. The reloading adds a sense of realism to Lethal Enforcers, making you watch your bullet count like a seasoned police veteran.

And you'll need good gun skills to take down your opponents. Within each of the five levels are a large assortment of masked gunmen, well-dressed drug dealers, and dedicated Chinese gangsters all itching to try out their automatic weaponry on you. Though the game has lost some difficulty in the face of newer contenders, stalling too long on shooting a target will result in catching a bullet. On the higher difficulty settings, your Mac-10 wielding adversaries will open fire as soon as they're in the clear, dispelling the widely held accusation that LE's bad guys peer out from behind a corner and wait to get shot.

To make sure that you don't go shooting things willy-nilly (after all, you do have a badge), LE throws in the civilians. Some practically beg for a bullet, standing straight up in the middle of a tense firefight with a gun-like camera shouting "NOT ME!" Others require your skill to save them from uncertain doom; a well-placed shot to the hostage taker allows the civilian to go free.

Myth number one: "You can't shoot me!"

The audio aspect of Lethal Enforcers cannot be denied praise. Though your gunshots are crisp, the cackle of enemy gunfire is menacing, and glass breaks with a piercing shatter, the real meat of this game lies in the charming enemy banter: "Eat lead!" shouts a guy in a ski-mask. "You can't shoot me!" boasts a grenade thrower, right before being shot in the head. The man hiding in the trunk of a car loudly exclaims, "You missed me, pig!" before giving you the opportunity to not miss him.

And although the audio translates near-flawlessly from the arcade, the graphics do not. It's clear Konami wanted the digitized graphics to convert to the SNES, but because of the console's limited colors the stages and enemies can be downright bland. Few frames of animation accompany a soon-to-be-dead marauder whirling around a corner with a shotgun, and much of the realism bestowed by real people becomes muddied by the inferior graphical port. The arcade version of Lethal Enforcers is made timeless by the fact that the graphics look real enough, but the SNES lacks this ability. Instead, choppy and near-featureless sprites replace their detailed arcade brothers.

As a console port, there wasn't enough of an attempt to distance the home version from the arcade in light of the inherent shortcomings as a direct port. The game can be played in easy, medium, and hard. However, certain areas are all but impossible in the hard mode while the majority of the game moves at a relatively sluggish pace in normal mode. The fine-tuning of modes would have helped, as would larger rewards for players of higher skill settings in the form of extra lives, more points, and a few exclusive guns (if it isn't asking too much). Lethal Enforcers offers none of this.

I remember back in the day when we light-gunmen fought bank robbers- not the undead!

Despite the few deficiencies it has as an arcade to SNES translation, the experience of Lethal Enforcers is still unmatched. The challenge of the boss fights, the chattering of the villains, and the realism of fighting real bad guys in real places all help to make Lethal Enforcers a watermark of light gun titles. While newer opponents attempt to steal LE's glory with better graphics, dogged enemies, and a few mechanical gimmicks, it is a task just short of impossible.

Lethal Enforcers has ironically become the "good cop" in the department it single-handedly created. Though now many consider it a bare bones light gun package eclipsed by houses of the dead and time crises, it plays by the book and offers you exactly what you want. With all of those "loose cannons" out there, Lethal Enforcers is a reliable and honest way to spend your free time.

OVERALL: 9 / 10
Some minutiae prevent perfection, but man is it close.

It's a difficult side-scroller where you play as either Riggs or Murtaugh and have to complete four missions in order to go on to the fifth and final mission. There is little difference between the two characters, other than Riggs having a faster rate of fire for his handgun, but at the cost of having a low jump height, while Murtaugh has a higher jump height at the cost of a low rate of fire for his handgun. The first four missions have you trying to do things such as rescue Leo Getz, defuse a bomb in a shopping mall, stop a dockside smuggling operation, and prevent terrorists from blowing up the city's sewer system. The final mission focuses on going after Jack Travis, the main villain of Lethal Weapon 3.

"History CAN be fun!"

For those of you who haven't figured it out already from the title, this game is about the Revolutionary War. I'm writing this review because I feel that the other reviews did not explain the details of the game well enough and had a number of glaring mistakes.

Liberty or death is a strategy/simulation game based on our war for independence. It was published by KOEI in 1994. At the time, KOEI was the premier simulation game developer. They also produced the Uncharted Waters series, the Romance of Three Kingdoms, and Heroes of Might and Magic. (Uncharted Waters is yet another masterful simulator)I am of the strong opinion that Liberty or Death was their best work, and is a must have for anyone willing to take the time to learn its complex game mechanics. Without further adieu, the review.

Concept: 9/10 This game really was the first of its kind. It's unprecedented depth set a new standard for the genre.

Graphics: 6/10 Certainly not the game's strongpoint. The visuals aren't an eyesore, but there's nothing that will wow you either. Every single character in the game (there's at least 200 of them if you count gov't officials) has his own picture, which adds a bit of flare.

Sound: 7/10 I have mixed feelings about this games sound. The gunfire, cavalry charges and explosions were only okay. The music in this game was really great. The various* songs were well written and truly capture the revolutionary spirit. They make you feel as though you've been transported back in time. The problem- there aren't enough of them. This game has about eight songs, if you count the intro and menu tracks. This may get slightly annoying, but you're usually so deep into formulating your stratagems and improving your army you won't particularly care. The music shouldn't be the focus of this type of game anyway.

Playability: 8/10 For those of you who read the review that said the menus only featured graphics and were too confusing to navigate, do not fear. The menus have NO graphics and are all text. (At least I can say that for the SNES version, I don't know about Genesis.) The first time you plunge into this game, you WILL have some trouble. As I said earlier, this game is very thick with options, and the menus feature a lot of choices. Fortunately, they are easy to navigate. You may be a bit confused for the first few hours of play, but the menus will be second nature to you after a few hours. If this makes you feel any better, I learned to play this game without the aid of an instruction manual. (Which is over 60 pgs, by the way.) In fact, it's better to disregard the instructions. You'll just be confused, and you learn almost everything after 8-12 hrs. (Though there are some details the instructions are good for.) Battles are also easy to pick up.

With a little patience, this game is very enjoyable and rewarding experience.

Entertainment: 9/10 This is where it's at. Note that the score you see comes from a history buff. If you don't like history but enjoy strategy, pick this title up regardless. Don't shy away from LoD because it seems complex. Pease trust me in that you will get into the thick of things quickly. I had countless hours of fun with it, and you will too. I constantly found myself addicted and couldn't put the controller down. Prepare to kiss away hours of your life after plugging this one into your console. LoD is a rarity in stores these days, but if you shop around, I guarantee you'll find a copy. I also have it for computer emulator, so it can be found online as well.

Replay Value: 6/10 You will play this game at least twice, one time for each side. Actually, you'll play more than that as your first few forays into LoD will invariably end in failure. (Remember, in a strat game of this caliber you can't expect to win unless you learn and use all tools at your disposal, which as I said will take a few hours.) You also may want to attempt the game on the ''Hard'' difficulty setting for further challenge. (Darn near impossible, as the AI in this game is very advanced and takes advantage of all opportunities to win that you throw at it.)

Final Words: This section outlines all of my thoughts and opinions that didn't fall into the above categories. As said in other reviews, the game is much harder to win with the British. (I've done it though)In fact, the Brits only have seven truly capable commanders. (Fortunately one of those seven is the best in the entire game.) The Americans will often get many more regiments and overwhelm the British forces. Here's a quick synopsis of the advantages of both sides. British: Better armed troops, more money (to start with, at least. The amount you get later depends on how much territory you control.), lots of naval support. Americans: Better commanders, larger army, easily gains initial control of northern colonies.

That's about all there is to say. If this review sparked even an inkling of your interest, try to find this game. It's a true strategy masterpiece, and a testament to history actually being fun.

This is a block-pushing puzzle game modeled after the king of all block-pushing puzzlers, The Adventures of Lolo. The premise is simple. You are the young magician (witch?) May, who must prove to her headmaster that she is strong enough to graduate from the Magic Academy. Her father must have forgot to make a donation to the school or something, so now she has to actually earn that C. How does she need to prove her magical ability? Pushing blocks around, that how, dammit. To advance, you gotta push the "Magic Block" onto a specially-marked tile which unlocks the stairway to heaven the next level. Sound easy? God damn, no. There's spikes that destroy the Magic Block, there's snakes that try to eat your eyes, and then there's the game mechanics, which it doesn't do very much in the way of explaining what they are and how they work. That must have been in the instruction manual? err? which we all have, because we only emulate games that we own, right? Right?!

If someone finishes the game, do Gideon Zhi a favor and send him a savestate just before the ending. The translation's probably complete, but no one has actually finished it yet.

Live A Live

Genre: Role Playing Game

Version: 2.00 Deluxe

Live A Live is an odd sort of game. At base, it's an RPG. What makes it different is it's separated into chapters. One has you playing as a cowboy, another as ninja, a third as martial arts master and his disciples. All the chapters are quite different. The ninja chapter, for instance, involves being a stealthy sneak and assissinating your rival without killing anyone else, or being a killing machine and cutting a swath through all the guards. The wrestler's chapter plays almost like a fighting game, as he faces off against his opponents one-on-one until he is the champ. All the characters join up at the end for the final chapter. I know, it sounds like Saga Frontier, but trust me, this game is actually good.

Translation Description:

We have all of the issues worked out (we hope!) It's gone through a few rigorous testing cycles, which continue even as I write this. The end result is a patch that blows everything else out of the water. This is very likely Aeon Genesis's definitive work, exceeding possibly even Rudra in its grandeur.

Tips:

Prehistoric Chapter Secrets
Both of these require you to see the scene with Gori and the female monkeys, and getting him back in your party at the Kuu Tribe caves. Both take place in the field where Gori and Pogo were first exiled to before.

KingMammoth 
To find this tough boss, look for him on the field.  Sniffing may show a running mammoth instead of a deer.  Win to get the KingFang.

Rock 
There's a rock that looks like a face near the upper right cave. Press A on it ONLY!! 100 times, then a cave opens. Offer a bone to the tablet inside.

Present Chapter-Extra Technique
Normally you would have to level Masaru to level 16 to get this technique, in the final chapter, but you CAN get it early!

Daigekido 
Fight Jackie Yowkeya. Bring down his HP, use Armlock and C. H. Hold on him (optional but it helps) and stand 1-2 squares away. Eventually he'll use it.  

Science Fiction Chapter-Saving on Captain Square
If you collect the MemoryCard item, you don't have to start Captain Square over each time!

MemoryCard 
After Kirk dies, go in his room, use the terminal and enter the password 'Warp'. Then check under his bed.

Looney Tunes B-Ball

Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Basketball
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Sunsoft
Publisher: Sunsoft
_________________________

The famous Looney Tunes characters get together for wild and wacky basketball games after filming. The gameplay is most similar to NBA Jam in that there are two players per team and many of the standard rules do not apply. For example, there is no travelling, no out-of-bounds, and definitely no fouls.

As you play, gems of various colors and values appear on the court. After obtaining enough of these, you can use them to do special moves to shoot the ball or attack your opponents. For example, the 'Vegas' special move requires 50 cents (equivalent to 50 gems) to use. It turns the scoreboard into a slot machine for one play. Once the slots are moving, you can make a basket (dunks don't count). The slots then stop and if you're lucky, they will multiply the amount of points you get, making it possible for some crazy comebacks. (NOTE: The gems only appear if the Wacky Meter option is at least 1 or higher).

One of the best features of the game is that every character has his own special abilities. For example, Yosemite Sam is short, but can hit three-pointers from almost anywhere. Wile E. Coyote isn't a great shooter, but can block anyone. Additionally, every character has his own Long-Range shot, a special move that costs 10 cents. For example, Elmer Fudd throws the ball over his head, pulls out his shotgun, says "Pull!", and then shoots the ball with the gun, launching it into the hoop. Some long-range shots are more accurate than others.

The game is unlike any other basketball game of the era in that you could enter cheat codes in the middle of the game to give yourself an advantage. For example, there is a cheat code to give both teams unlimited gems, so you can use special moves constantly without running out of money. These codes are entered via a sequence of button presses, such as A, B, X, Y, Left, Right, etc.

Looney Tunes B-Ball is one of the relatively few games for the SNES that allowed four players to play simultaneously using the SNES Multitap.

There are many fans of the game who hope it will be released on the Virtual Console for Wii, especially since it is difficult to obtain the original cartridge.

Tips:

All of these codes can be entered any time during gameplay.

THE SINISTRALS RETURN!

Greetings, young hero. The mists of time reveal that you have not yet begun your quest. Who am I? A poet, a seer, one with just a bit of magic in his fingers -- no one of real importance. I exist only to assist you. It is said you are known by many names -- I will simply call you Hero. I have come to prepare you for a journey into darkness, to give you the secrets you must know to conquer the corrupt forces threatening our world.

The terror began one hundred years ago, when the Sinistrals appeared in our sky on their floating island. Humanity was thrown into panic as the four nightmare beings, Chaos, Destruction, Terror, and Death, spread their dark powers across our land. I was a child then. Yes, I saw it all... and remembered. Our greatest warriors threw their lives away trying to defeat the Sinistrals. Then the only four surviving heroes gathered. They were Artea, Guy, and Selan, with Maxim, their leader. They fought a mighty battle against the Sinistrals and won. That was 99 peaceful years ago.

But now, young Hero, the Sinistrals have risen again on their strange island. They call upon the power of night and send forth their foul servants to revenge themselves upon us all. You, with your three companions, must become the new band of heroes to destroy the Sinistrals.

I will help you get started by showing you how Maxim led his warriors to victory. You will find yourself living that day of tremendous courage and strife. I have just enough magic in me to draw aside the curtain of time and let you walk in the steps of Maxim. I will try to send you close to the last battle. Use this opportunity to learn and gain experience for your own mission. Feel yourself change as you become Maxim ...

--From the SNES Lufia and the Fortress of Doom instruction manual.

Overview:

Lufia and the Fortress of Doom is a lot of fun to play. It's no wonder it's one of our most popular games. There is a terrific story to the game and the graphics look great. The fact that Lufia is an RPG helps it's popularity too. A lot of the people that use our service love RPG's. A lot of people have misconceptions about what a role playing game (RPG) is. Originally, the term just meant a game in which you play the role of another (usually fictional) person. Then, it started to be used to describe games such as D&D and the like. As a matter of fact, I still think of D&D whenever I hear the term. Now, however, it is used to describe almost any game that has one or all of the elements mentioned above. RPG's used to be for what most people would call nerds, now RPG gamers are diverse and numerous. 

RPG's have gone mainstream with games like Final Fantasy (parts 1-100 or something), Harvest Moon, and now they even have a Lord of the Rings RPG entitled The Third Age. RPG's are some of the most challenging games that software developers have to offer. If you like them, then give Lufia and the Fortress of Doom a try!

Directions:

Complete your mission by fighting your way through the dungeons and defeating the Sinistrals for good.....or so you think.

Lufia is filled with RPG elements such as, round based combat, random encounters, random item generation, the ability to advance your character's level, the ability to dress your character in whatever armor/protective gear you want, and of course, role playing.

General Fixes:

- Glitched map names (Gratze Kingdom, Capsule Monsters Cave)

- Glitched Submarine Shrine/Ancient Cave Final Floor maps

- Battle background for Shrine of Vengeance B2

- Music menu glitch (AKA the "Level 0" bug)

- Equip menu glitch (e.x. Tia has a Knife, Maxim has "no equip". Scroll from Maxim to Tia. Now, Tia suddenly has a Knifeuip equipped. What's fixed is that last part.)

Item Problems:

- Statue (Doesn't freeze/reset the game when used at the main menu)

- Sea ring (Makes attacks fire elemental.)

Miscellaneous:

- PERCELYTE

- Grassei Kingdom

- ball of Chence

- Bunny girls restored

- One or two other minor bugs/errors

Disclaimer: In his own words, the creator of this hack never released it for the following reasons:

- "I never played through whole patched ROM to see if everything is alright. I verified that each of the changes I made works as intended, but I can't be 100% sure than I didn't screw some other things up while tinkering with the game."

- "The most important reason in my eyes: I never took the time to write the credits. Several people helped me during the creation of this patch, and I really wanted to mention all of them in the readme file."

History Past

In its long history, the land of Lufia, like most civilizations, has experienced both the devastation of war and the prosperity of peace. According to Lufian legend, the ultimate disaster was averted generations ago when four brave heroes saved their people from certain destruction at the hands of villainous creatures known as Sinistrals. Although the courage and fame of these bold warriors has been passed down through the ages in legend and myth... it was not the first time they rescued their homeland from the threat of destruction. Now the complete history of their brave heroics will unfold for all to see.

Power and Glory

There are many reasons for war: greed, a difference in beliefs, or a hunger for power. The Sinistrals started a war for the most selfish of reasons. They simply wanted the land of Lufia for their own. And they knew that the time to strike was when the Dual Blade, a sword of great power, was resonating. Arek, the leader of the Sinistrals, could read the signs. The Dual Blade would be his key to victory. The poor, pitiful Humans of the land would soon know the power of the Dual Blade. And Arek would have victory for once and for all.

A Time For Heroes

The Sinistrals may have the upper hand with the knowledge of the Dual Blade's power, but the Humans are not done yet. If the monster hunter, Maxim, has anything to say about the future of the world, the Sinistrals will not have their wish. His story has begun. Now he will find others who will join his revolution against the Sinistrals. Now he will find the source of the war on the world. And, now his band of warriors will rise triumphantly over the Sinistrals. At least, that's the plan.
--from the SNES Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals instruction manual

This game was a lot of fun to play. The graphics were some of the best I've ever seen on the SNES. The colors are very bright and the rendering of the characters and monsters are great. I like very much the round based combat style. If you like RPG's, you'll love Lufia II.

Directions:

Stop the Sinistrals from taking over the world. 

Lufia II, and Lufia I for that matter, was one of the best games ever put on the SNES. A lot of people like RPG's and this is one to remember. The game starts you off in town and you meet a shop owner girl that is obviously wanting to be your woman. After you sell her some monsters you've captured you can buy some stuff from her if you want. After that you will be approached by an old man that wants you to meet him in a southern cave for a tutorial on dungeon exploring. When you get done with that, you can go back to town and you will hear some upsetting news after you eat dinner with the shop owner girl. Monsters have taken over the northern cave and they want you to win it back, hence, your first assignment. 

Controls:

A Button - Confirm, Talk, Open Chest, Get Item
B Button - Cancel Command, Swing Sword (outside combat)
X Button - Item Info, Hide Menu
Y Button - Use Skill
L Button - Quick Attack, Special Skill
R Button - Attack Multiple Enemies, Change Direction Without Moving
Start Button - Start, Verify
Select Button - Select from Menu

Hints:

Ending bonus:
Successfully complete the game and allow the credits to end. Eventually, information about how well you did during the game will appear.

Tips:

Easy Capsule leveling up.
To do this, feed any Capsule Monster a Long Knife (purchasable at any store early on) Now, save the game.  Use the soft reset (l + R + start + select) When you load, instead of requiring a rarer item for the next feeding, you'll only have to use another Long Knife.  This is an apparent glitch that resets the list of items needed to level up monsters. NOTE: You MUST use the Soft Reset option, not a regular reset)

Easy Egg Dragon
To defeat the Egg Dragon in less than one round, you only need: A healing item/spell and enough hit points to survive his attack.  First, you just heal him and then attack him once and he will die.  This is because he has max possible hp and the programmers forgot a hp-cap to prevent this.

Secret Game Modes
Once you've beaten the game the first time through you will unlock the retry mode. In this mode you will receive four times as much exp and gold as the first time through. Then once you beat the game with retry mode you unlock gift mode. This is useful only for the Ancient Dungeon, it allows you to select your party for the dungeon.

Unlock Gift mode without beating the game twice
Defeat the Jelly at the bottom of the Ancient Cave in your first play-through and you will receive the Gift mode option without having to beat the game in retry mode.

_________________________
*
Madden NFL '94 is a football video game released in 1993. It was the first game in the Madden series with an official NFL team license, as well as the first Madden game that allowed players to play a full regular season (via a password system).

It was the first Madden game to use the famous "EA Sports - It's in the Game" audio tag. It also introduced the "Flip play", "Play-call mode", "Pass-catch mode" and "Bluff play" options to the series. This was the first Madden title to pause the action and rotate the screen during punts, kickoffs and turnovers, rather than instantly reversing P.O.V. to the opposite side of the field, which could be disorienting to players. The field could also be rotated to view plays from any angle in instant replay.

This was also the first of the Madden game to have Super Bowl teams available for play without any special codes.

Due to an error, the entire rosters for the New York Giants and New York Jets were reversed. For example, the quarterback for the Jets was #11 (Phil Simms of the Giants) while the quarterback for the Giants was #7 (Boomer Esiason of the Jets). This error affected at least the copies for SNES available during the Christmas shopping season of 1993.

_________________________

Madden NFL '95 was the first Madden to showcase no passing windows. Previously included "Past Championship Teams" and "All-Franchise" teams were not included. This is the first Madden game to save season mode via a cartridge battery. Player stats were tracked individually both in-game, and throughout a season. The cover has John Madden on it, but it also features two generic players on it.

It is the first to be released to a handheld, being released for the first time to both the Game Boy and Game Gear.

Tips:

Expansion Teams
Before beginning a new game, go to the Game Setup Screen and highlight either the Home or Visiting Team Options.
Press L, R, L, R, A to play as the Jaguars or press L, R, L, R, Y to play as the Panthers

One minute game time
In exhibition mode, go to game length, and hit L, R, L, R, X. You should get one minute game time.

69 Bears
To Play with the 69 Bears and little Walter press YYXY at the team select

Easily block punts
When the computer is forced to punt, select the 'Punt Rush' formation, then take control of your fastest player and line him up on the left side of the field, just outside the leftmost offensive lineman.  Remember to use the line of scrimmage glitch to your advantage and move him down a little bit.  When the ball is snapped, you'll easily be able to use your superior speed to charge in and block the punt due to the running back in the punt formation never moving over to assist in the blocking scheme. It should be noted that while this glitch is practically identical to the glitch seen in Madden '94, you need to be much faster this time around to pull it off correctly.

Easy defense
Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but
a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 95 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place.  When the ball is snapped, you'll have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.

Guaranteed Two Point Conversions
After scoring a touchdown, you can use a very simple glitch to guarantee yourself an extra two points.  Select Goal Line Halfback Lead Left.  The AI will always come out with their Field Goal block team and call an audible. Snap the ball while they're running around like idiots changing their defense around and you'll have a free path to the end
zone every single time.

The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret "classic" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the "superteams" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.

This was the first edition of Madden to implement the use of a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also featured the new Baltimore Ravens, the expansion franchise that absorbed the roster of the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96) which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and could be played by using a cheat code.

Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.

Madou Monogatari: Big Kindergarten Kids
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game , Fantasy
Release Year: 2004
Players: 1
Original Title: Madou Monogatari: Hanamaru Daiyouchienji
Translated By: Aeon Genesis, J2e Translations
Version: 1.01
_________________________
*
OH MY GOD CUTE. Madou Monogatari follows the adventures of the adorable Puyo Puyo mascot Arle, as she tries to find eight crystals, which in doing so will grant her one wish. You know what she wishes for? To pass kindergarten. Go on, say "awwwww". We won't tell.

Even though it's based on Puyo Puyo characters (or, as Gideon Zhi is so quick to mention, Puyo Puyo is based on Madou Monogatari characters), this is an RPG through and through. So if you suck at Puyo Puyo (like me) or just plain don't like it, well, you need to play this game anyways. It does away with your typical RPG conventions in a way that you really wouldn't expect in some cutesy little Puyo Puyo game.

Like, there's no indicator of your hit points at all. All you have to go on is all the dancing around that Arle does. I mean, if she's just kinda drooping there, with her eyes all spirally lines, you better Goddamn well heal that girlie, stat. You're a magic user, so you don't have any actual physical attacks at your disposal. You've got your three core attack spells (Fire, Ice Storm, Lightning) at your disposal, which don't use any magic power (for which, again, there's no indicator), and then you've got all your other spells, like Healing and some other stuff. If you cast Bayoen on a monster, and Arle tells you she has plenty of magic power, then you're still doing ok.

There's a whole hell of a lot of walking around going on, but the game world is pretty small, so it's not that bad. Plus, you've got these awesome flying squirrels that you can ride. It's pretty badass, man.

Translation Description:

J2e's necrosaro was working on this, but I guess passed it off to Gideon Zhi to finish. And now Gideon Zhi's done with it. Love them. The current version fixes some bugs that appeared in version 1.0.

Tips:

Automatically win easy battles
When the screen goes black after encountering a weak enemy, hold down L or R and you will skip the battle but you will receive experience and cookies as if you have fought the battle normally.

Sound Test
Behind the Devil's Door, in Bazaar, talk to Sasori man (a guy that looks like a scorpion) and take a ride to the ancient town. Travel slowly and listen to the Dark Concert to be able to listen any music from the game.

Magic Knight Rayearth
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1999
Players: 1
Original Title: Mahou Kishi Rayearth
Translated By: LNF Translations, RPGe
Version: 1.01
_________________________
*
I played this a little when the translation first came out. Now that I have to play it again for this review, I remember why I stopped.

If you people know anything, you'll know that Magic Knight Rayearth is a popular manga/anime series in Japan, and also here, sort of. Most people say it's a bad game, because they all say it's "too easy" or "too short." This is, of course, all coming from people who have never seen the MKR anime or manga. The game follows the manga's plot pretty much from beginning to end (I assume), so seeing the anime/manga isn't exactly a prerequisite. But if you haven't, then it'll just be some short easy RPG for you. The reason I don't like it is that the battles are painfully slow. It just gets annoying after a while, OK?

For those who are wondering, "Hey, is this anything like the Saturn version of Rayearth?" the answer is, "No, not in the slightest." The Saturn version r0x though.

Translation Description:

Note the file MKRHARD.IPS in the zip file. This modifies the way that HP is gained when you go up a level. I haven't tried it myself, but I assume that the only thing that changes is the game's difficulty.

Magic Sword
Platform: Super NES

Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1992
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
_________________________

Greetings, Hero. You stand at the entrance of Dragon Tower to defeat the evil Drokkmar. Save you allies that are hidden within the tower and will help you along your way. It's up to you to save the land from Drokkmar's evil reign of terror. But be sure not to let your greed take over. Good Luck hero, you're gonna need it.

Magic Sword is a wonderful beat'em-up game that is similar to Golden Axe. The graphics in this game are good, with somewhat realistic magical effects and interesting monsters. The music is this game is adventurous and keeps you sucked into the game, just as must as the gameplay itself. I highly recommend this game for all players.

Directions:

You play the Hero in this beat'em-up game as you run through Dragon Tower to rid the world of the Evil Overlord, Drokkmar. Run through all 50 levels of the tower, wielding your Magic Sword as you go, to get to the evil overlord.

Defeat the bosses, which are the overlord's wizards transformed into evil dragon-like creatures. From them you can gain upgraded swords. Use your magic to defeat the overlord's armies that await you in the tower, such as skeleton's, gargoyles, and ogres. Smash chests to get upgraded shields and food which increase your health. Be sure to keep an eye on your health, which is in the lower left hand corner of the screen. Coming into contact with enemies, traps, and water will deplete your health. Your health also depletes over time, so be sure to eat food to keep from dying; also you only have three lives, so fight carefully.

Along your way you will collect keys which you can use to open doors and free your friends imprisoned within the tower, just stand in front of a locked door and press up. Your allies will fight alongside you in your quest, although only one ally will fight with you at a time. Your allies include thieves, archers, wizards, barbarians, and knights. Collect coins from slain enemies to get points, and after collecting so many points, a food fairy will come by and give you food. So get on your computer and draw your sword. The freedom of your land rests in your hands. 

Controls:

A Button - ATTACK
B Button - JUMP
X Button - MAGIC BLAST
Y Button - MAGIC
Start Button - PAUSE
Select Button - NOTHING

Tips:

New Options
At the Options screen Highlight Exit then Hold L + R + Start on controller 2. Then exit on controller one. At the new option mode you can change many things

This is the classic color-matching puzzle game, much like Puyo Puyo or Bust-A-Move if you've played those. Except this game is kind-of backwards. The blocks are already there, you have to rearrange them so that there's at least three of the same color vertically adjacent to eachother. Doing that makes them disappear, and makes your opponent's stack increase in size. Oh, yeah, there's a CPU-controlled opponent. And of course when he matches up blocks, YOUR stack grows. Unfortunatley, the CPU is way better than I am at this. So, um, yeah.

It seems that everything is translated in this, which must not have been a super-duper feat since the only text is the menus and the intro. :-)

I think this game takes away Umihara Kawase's title as Cutest Game Ever. Although Rhapsody also comes close. Even after watching the opening story, the plot isn't really clear as to why this adorable little princess has to go and take down all these demons or what have you. But, you don't play these kind of games for their story.

You're a princess. Who looks a lot like Little Red Riding Hood except you're, uh, Blue. And you're adorable. Anyways, your goal is to jump around and swing your sword at enemies, until there's no more enemies to swing your sword at. Basically. You also get powerups, that you can use with the A button, and you have your super badass attack, that you use with Select. But basically it's just your usual charming platformer that's really fun to play. Tada!

Translation Description:

Everything's complete. Isn't that font awesome? Yeah it is.

Gideon Zhi says the ending might not show up properly on a copier. Then again, maybe it will. It hasn't been thoroughly tested yet, I guess.

So when you see the graphics, you will probably think "God damn, they ripped off Final Fantasy" because man, those sprites are totally FF, man. The combat's pretty weird, you just kinda watch as your party attacks this other party. Yup, see? Weird.

Oh no! Bowser and his bad boys are back to a life of crime. This time, it's not Mario World -- it's your world! From his Antarctic castle, Bowser hustles his cold-blooded crew of cantankerous Koopas into his powerful Passcode Operated Remote Transport And Larceny System (PORTALS). The twisted turtles transport themselves throughout the globe, where celebrated cities suffer shocking crime waves, as turtles trash landmarks and loot ancient artifacts. With dough from his slimy sales, Bowser hoards hair dryers from the Hafta-Havit Hotline. His plot? Melt Antarctica and flood the planet! Whoa!

Will the brave brothers from Brooklyn permit this abominable snow plan? The boys say "Not!" Mario, Luigi and Yoshi trek across ice and snow to shellac the shelled ones' schemes. But Bowser's slick; in one last trick, he takes the dearest thing of all... Mario is Missing!

Luigi must stop the Koopas, foil Bowser's plan, and find Mario. Sneaking into each Portal, Luigi is transported to a city in trouble. There, Luigi needs to nab each Koopa, grab its loot, and return the artifact to its proper landmark. Along the way, Luigi explores the city, chats with the locals, reads the maps, and solves puzzles. Help him do this before time runs out! Once he figures out where he is on the globe, Luigi must use the "Globulator" to call Yoshi. Only after Yoshi scares Pokey away, can Luigi return to Bowser's castle and lock the Portal for that city.

--From the SNES Mario Is Missing! instruction manual.

Overview:

OH NO!!! Mario has gone missing. What's even worse is that Bowser has set up a castle in the Antarctic and plans to melt the ice to flood the world. In order to do this he is going to use a crap load of hair dryers. In order to fund this plan, he has sent his Koopa Troopas to steal artifacts from across the world. Now it's up to Luigi to get the artifacts back, stop Bowser, and save Mario, who is imprisoned somewhere in Bowser's castle. So good luck, Luigi!

Mario is Missing! is a fun game that is not only entertaining but also educational. The graphics are good and stay true to the classic Mario look. The music is the classic Mario music, but it plays in the style of wherever in the world you happen to be. All in all, this is a worthwhile game to play.

Directions:

You play Luigi as you visit cities across the world to return artifacts to their rightful place. Wander the streets of cities all over the world, such as San Francisco to Rome. 

Each level has five cities, all of which need to have their artifacts returned to them. Luigi must go through and stomp on Koopas to find them. Once Luigi has the artifacts, he must go to the information points to talk to Princess Toadstool (who oddly enough works at every one of them). Get information about the artifacts from pamphlets that the princess gives you, or from people walking around the street. Then you must take the artifact to the Princess and answer her questions about it.

After restoring all the artifacts, you must figure out where Luigi is in the world, and move Yoshi there with the Globatron, which can be accessed in the Menu. With Yoshi, you can scare the guardian of the Blue Tube which takes you back to the castle. Also in the Menu are: what artifacts you have; your computer, which keeps track of the information you have gathered; and your camera, which lets you take pictures.

One word of advice: restore all the artifacts before leaving. If you leave early, you have to do it all over again. Once all five cities of one stage are complete, the Koopa Kid guarding the level must be defeated to progress to the next level. Don't worry though, there is no way for you to be hurt, the Koopa Kid just runs around and is difficult to jump on. Ludwig, Roy, and Iggy are the only Koopa Kids that get involved. After defeating them, you must fight Bowser and save Mario. Good Luck, Luigi, and hurry to save Mario!

Mario Paint
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Mouse
Genre: Educational , Graphic
Release Year: 1992
Developer: Nintendo
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: 1
_________________________
*
The game allowed the user to create artwork using various tools controlled by a mouse (similar to computer painting programs like Microsoft Paint). Not only could the user paint and draw freehand, but colorless pre-made drawings could be displayed and then colored in using various methods similar to coloring books. Another feature included pictures that could be inserted with the stamp tool. Stamps of everyday objects such as the Sun and fruit were provided by default, and users could even make custom stamps pixel-by-pixel. Several publications, such as Nintendo Power, released how-to guides on how to create iconic Nintendo related stamps for use within Mario Paint. Besides just creating static pictures, a user could also make simple looping animations which could then be set to music created in the music generator. 

These animations painted by the user could only be viewed on a television screen, and while instructions were provided to users on how to record these to a video cassette recorder, there was no other way to export any of the work done in Mario Paint.

Mini Games:

Mario Paint also contains a fly-swatting mini-game, known as "Coffee Break" or "Gnat Attack," which is a fast-paced action game that takes full advantage of the Super NES mouse. The player controls a gloved hand (similar to the one seen on the title screen) holding a flyswatter, which must swat flying insects on the screen, before the insect stings the player's hand in one way or another. There are three levels, each with 100 insects and a boss. When you win the last boss it takes you back to level one and adds a small icon in the top left corner of the screen. There is no final level or reward, as the game will loop endlessly.

The title screen for Mario Paint proved to be a mini-game of sorts. The user was able to click each letter in the title to trigger a certain action. Certain letters would cause the music to change, have Yoshi run by on screen, make Mario shrink and grow, and even allow the user to temporarily paint the background. Also, occasionally, a star would fly across the screen very quickly which the user could click on and make it rain down lots of stars and change the music for the duration of this.

Tips:

Messed up scenery.
When you click the letter that makes the grass appear along with several things such as fire flowers trains and animals, every so often a star will shoot down, if you manage to click it (which can be difficult) the music will change and everything will mess up by raining all sorts of objects.

Alternate Music
Click on the letter I or O in the word Mario.

Change Mario's Size
Click on the letter M in the word Mario Paint.

Color Title Screen
Click on the letter T in the word Paint

Hidden Sounds
Click on the letter P in the word Mario Paint.

Hit Mario
Click on the letter A in the word Mario Paint.

Living Undoing Dog
Click on the grid icon and wait. After a while, the undo icon will come to life and will walk around. If you move the mouse, it will run back and turn into an icon.

Secret Developer's song
When Mario turns and faces away from the screen on the title screen, quickly click on him (he turns away fast). If you do this correctly there'll be a chanting song as you enter the game.

Shake the Screen
Click on the letter I in the word Paint.

"Not as good as Fun with numbers, but i still learned how to spell C-A-T"

Yes a 9. This game is just that good, but MEY: Fun with numbers was better. But it is still good. I can say that even though I am 14 (seriously.) This game has a lot. It is just that damn amazing. I remember when I was little I would play this for hours on end. Then I got in trouble and had to sit in the corner. Well, on with the review.

GRAPHICS: 9/10
The graphics are colourful and bright, just like most Mario games. Everything is high in detail, and you can make out everything quite easily. They are not as nice as Donkey Kong Country's but they are still very good.

SOUND/MUSIC: 2/10
O.K, to be honest, the game has the worst sound ever, and no music. After you solve a problem it will go You - chose - pig. P - I- G, pig, which gets more annoying than the Backstreet Boys. The only good sounds are when you get the question right. A zany little dude will pop out of somewhere and go ''I like your choice!'' or ''That works for me!'' etc.

CHALLENGE-5/10
I gave the challenge 5/10 because for most people over the age of at least 10, it would be a 1, max. But for preschoolers, they would find it quite challenging, and would give it about a 9-ish, so I chose the score in between 1 and 10.

CONTROLS-10/10
Perfect. They could not be better. They are also very simple, you only have to use 2 buttons. They are also very tight, and not unresponsive or sloppy. A lot of games could learn from this game.

GAMEPLAY-9/10
Okay, here we go. This game is very fun. It actually seems a lot more fun now than when I got it in preschool(weird). In this game you either control mario, Yoshi or Princess Peach.
You move your err, magic hand around the island and solve all the crazy spelling/letter problems. A good concept. It is a very fun game (especially if you are about 5-7). This game is almost as fun as football.

MULTIPLAYER-N/A
Although it would be a very nice feature, there is no multiplayer in this game.

LEARNING-8/10
By ''learning'' I mean how well it teaches young kids. It does well. For some reason Mario seams to tach them a lot more than any school could.But it would be better if there was sound. There are several different islands, all with there own fun learning activity.

VALUE-5/10
Once again, if you are about 5-7, then I recomend this game. However, if you are older than that I don't recomend this game (unless you are totally insane, like me).

RENT OR BUY-Buy
If you are under 8, I recomend to buy it. If you are over this, rent it.

Ah, the easy life. For Mario, that is. And that also describes the game. Too easy. Even for a preschool child it's too easy. I wouldn't even dig this game as a 3 or 4 year old. Although the animations are really catchy. Bottom line: Nintendo made a grave mistake making this game. Children of course love playing as the mustached Plumber, but they'd rather see him stomping on goombas rather than bumping his head on a red square.

Directions:

You are Mario, Peach, or Yoshi and you're playing games that have no end and no reward. The games are to challenge youngsters about numbers, letters, shapes, sizes and the like.

A Button - Pick things on certain games

Mario's Return Again
Platform: Super NES
Region: Update Hacks
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 2009
Original Title: Super Mario World
Hacked By: Stark
_________________________
*
Hello. My name is Michael Stark. You might know me as an administrator on board2. Several years ago, I made a Mario World hack named "Mario's Return." While I liked the core of it, it had many flaws and could have been much better than it was. It also had a number of very odd glitches. I thought about showing it to some friends of mine about a month ago, but realized that there was just so much about it that was utterly ameteurish in terms of design... It would not have been very flattering for me.

With that in mind, I tossed around the idea of going back through it and fixing up a few things from here to there. It didn't go anywhere for awhile, but at one point, I found spare time, and I set to work. It quickly developed beyond just making it a bit better; I wanted this to actually be something worth playing, rather than the forgettable trash that most ROM hacks end up as.

I went through many levels, especially the most linear ones, and touched things up, adding a few extra paths and items here and there, and adjusted the difficulty curve to be in general more forgiving but basically just more consistent. I also completely remade a few parts which I just didn't like. One level in particular, Secret 3, was basically utter trash, and I replaced it completely. I went out of my way to find complaints about the previous release and address them. For various reasons, I couldn't address all of them, but I won't say I didn't do my damnedest. I also rewrote pretty much all the text in the game, as it was quite poor before.

In addition to general touchups and making it suck less, I also added a small amount of completely new content. I added a new Big Boo fight to replace a Reznor fight in the secret path of the last fortress. Further, one of the most common things that people said is that there's no real 'reward' for getting everything. Now, however, completing the secret world grants a new final level, which is... Interesting. I like how the whole thing turned out, to be certain.

Still, if you have played the original "Mario's Return" then there's not much that will surprise you - this is very much the same hack, it's just been polished.

This is a beta not in the commonly-seen sense of "I want to show something off even though I'm not done," but rather in the professional sense of "I think this is done, but if testers find problems then I will address them before distributing the completed product." One thing in particular that you should keep in mind, however, is that this is very much a hack from 2006, and I have kept my old sensibilities. There's little ExGFX, and all graphics retain their simple, "everything is the same style, nothing is out of place in Mario World" aesthetic. I also am retaining the game's original music, because I like it, and I feel that it fits. There are a few custom sprites, but nothing made with Sprite Tool or what have you, because that tool was not available to me when I released the hack the first time. With that said...

This hack contains 88 exits across 68 levels.

Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Domark

_________________________

Colonel Brown, the evil owner of a toy factory, has created a substance that can turn people and animals into mutant sludge monsters. When Marko's football comes in touch with the substance it gets magical powers, giving Marko the power to stop Colonel Brown.

Now Marko has to find his way through numerous platform levels filled with enemies and obstacles. Using his magic football, he can perform various moves and attacks. He can kill his enemies with different kicks, header shots or even bicycle kicks and also use his ball as a trampoline.

The SNES version features two additional moves for Marko (the ability to balance on the ball and a different method of returning it to him), but they do not have a great impact on gameplay.

Players: 1
_________________________
*
Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems is a side-scrolling platformer/beat 'em up based on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline from the comics. Adam Warlock calls on the heroes to recover the 6 Infinity Gems before they are used for evil.

You may choose ones of five heroes: Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Wolverine. Each one has different stats and abilities. (i.e. Spider-Man is agile. Hulk is strong, Iron Man can double-jump with his rocket boots, etc.) Initially you can choose a training area in Avenger headquarters or four levels. As you complete levels, most open up. Each hero can be equipped with gems to boost their abilities in each section. These must be obtained by finding them in the levels.

Gameplay is fairly similar to X-Men-Mutant Apocalypse. Combat is all on a 2D plane. Each hero has basic jumps and attacks and special moves that can be executed with button combinations like quarter-rolls. Enemies include various villains from the Marvel Universe and evil doubles of various Marvel heroes.

Developer: Bits Corporation
Publisher: Sony Imagesoft
Players: 1
_________________________

Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a video game for multiple platforms that is based on the 1994 movie of the same name. The player controls Frankenstein's monster as he stomps through the streets of Ingolstadt, Bavaria (now Ingolstadt, Germany) in the year 1793 seeking revenge against a certain man named Victor for rejecting him once he was created. Since he is a product of artificial manufacturing (instead of natural childbirth through a human mother), he is condemned and declared an expendable pariah by the mostly illiterate peasants and soldiers. The common folks that strive to kill Frankenstein's monster are highly ignorant about modern science and believe that he is truly a demon. The player gets to use a wooden stick at enemies that do not accept him for who he is.

The stick that Frankenstein's monster carries can be put on fire if swung towards fire. Frankenstein also has an additional attack; a blue ball of negative energy that pops up when the player releases the button. Peasants in the game can either be male or female; soldiers are always male. The female peasants attack with pots while the male peasants attack with melee weapons. However, the soldiers (men dressed in red) attack the player with musket shots. Simple puzzles involving switches and pulleys must be solved in order to progress within the levels.

The game's story is a simple rescue mission, centering on the efforts of Blasternaut to retrieve Spot from the clutches of the malicious "Trash Alien," who, apparently, litters out of sheer spite. The garbage he leaves behind consists primarily of empty containers and bad food, though coil-springs, boots and fish skeletons are also present.

In the opening scenes, Spot and Blasternaut are preparing for a journey aboard their rocket-like spaceship, only to find that the ship is not functional. Blasternaut, jumping to conclusions, sends Spot to repair a mechanism known as the "polytronic combustion regulator" and Spot reluctantly begins repairs, while Blasternaut goes below deck.

As Spot works, the Trash Alien flies by, captures Spot and departs, leaving garbage everywhere. Blasternaut, upon discovering this, contacts his superior officer, Galactic Commander, and notifies her of the situation. Galactic Commander immediately identifies the criminal and sends Blasternaut to collect the trash, use it to fuel his ship, track down the Trash Alien and destroy his spacecraft.

Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow
Platform: Super NES

Release Year: 1996
Developer: Eurocom Entertainment Software
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: 1
_________________________

Maui Mallard is a "medium-boiled" detective visiting a tropical island when the mysterious Shabum Shabum idol goes missing. Shabum Shabum is considered the island's native guardian spirit, and unless the idol is recovered, the whole island will explode. Maui is put on the case, and his investigations lead him through a creepy mansion to a native village, where Maui is sacrificed and thrown into a volcano as a sacrifice to the native gods. Maui survives the volcano, and the islanders put him through the "test of duckhood", which Maui passes, gaining the natives' trust. The natives tell Maui that the only one who knows where Shabum Shabum is has died long since, and Maui goes through the land of the dead to escort his soul into rest. Ultimately, the location of Shabum Shabum is revealed, and Maui goes head-to-head with an evil sorcerer over the idol. 

Maui is triumphant, and as a sign of their gratitude, the islanders name their island after their hero, despite their misgivings that the name "Mallard" has little potential for attracting tourists.

Gameplay:

Besides typical platform game gameplay (running around, jumping from platform to platform), one of the game's most distinctive gameplay features is allowing to switch the player character's form to suit one's needs. 

The player begins the game as Maui, whose only mean of self-defence is an insect-launching pistol that can launch several forms of bugs, some of them combined for greater effect. However, once the player reaches the second level, Maui transforms into Cold Shadow, his ninja alter ego, who defends himself with short-range attacks using a staff. Cold Shadow's staff is also primarily used to explore the level further, such as climbing a narrow tunnel. After the second level, the player can switch back and forth between Maui and Cold Shadow at will, provided he has enough ninja tokens for the transformation. The amount of ninja tokens Maui or Cold Shadow holds determines Cold Shadow's strength when played as him. Some levels of the game, however, prevent Maui from transforming at all, as Cold Shadow cannot bungee jump on vines, for example, which forces the player to use Maui throughout the level.

A robot named Eagle is blocked from participating in the world's professional golfing tournaments due to ignorance. Eagle has the ability to play golf better than a human being but is denied the chance to do so. A benefactor purchases Eagle and builds a golf course for him to practice on. The player's skill determine whether humans or robots are truly better at golf. Various modes (lesson, driving range, competition) helps the player practice his abilities that he will need in future matches.

It is possible to save a game while in the middle of a golfing session. Through practice and the driving range, duffers can improve their maximum yardage, their handicap, and eventually get promoted from duffer status. "Semi-pro" and "pro" levels are considered to be the two highest levels a video game golfer can receive in this video game.

Emergency lessons offer advice when a player is about to perform a mistake in the practice (learning) mode of the game; the player only needs to hit the X button to activate the lesson. After the 13th hole, the players must use a small boat to get to the 14th hole regardless of what mode the player is using. Like most Super NES golfing games, the clubs are selected automatically for the player, and he must aim the ball and strike it with accuracy and balance. Players get to choose between four sets of golf clubs. The ones with the bunnies on them are considered to be beginners' golf equipment; they don't give off very good yardage and the starting handicap is 36. As the player plays in various months of the year, the golf course changes. Winter offers completely faded grass while summer brings out the most amount of colors in this video game.

In the Japanese version, an all-male group of Japanese golfers replaces the character's family members due to cultural and ethnic reasons. While the Japanese golfers were of Asian background, the "family members" in the North American version are shown to be Caucasian.

3017

It was the year of the septicentennial of the founding of the Federated Suns. For exactly 700 years, House Davion had ruled this portion of the Inner Sphere. Herra Ragen's father was a Colonel of an elite force in the powerful Davion army, but the army of Hanse Davion was not on the planet of Redondo that fateful night of January 12th. Colonel Joseph T. Ragen was an idol to his son. He was the best MechWarrior in the best force in the army of the best of the Successor Houses. But there was more to the man than the boy knew. The colonel had been working to infiltrate and destroy the renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance--and he'd learned entirely too much. Somehow, the location of his residence had leaked to the Dark Wing Lance, and a plan was drawn up for a covert hit operation. 

Before taking action, the members made a pact; immediately after the hit they would disband and lay low for 10 years, maintaining a code of strict secrecy, before regrouping to again undertake their nefarious enterprise.

Under cover of night, the lance attacked. While playing at a friend's house, young Herras heard the sounds of the firing. Rushing home, he found a roaring inferno where he and his mother and father and sister had lived and eaten and laughed and cried together. Orphaned at the age of 12; he vowed that someday he would have revenge on those who had done this.

3027

The outrage and shock that echoed through every home in the Federated Suns has long since died down, but it lives on in the heart of Herras Ragen, now a young man. After he saw what happened to his family, Herras could not serve the House of Davion. Now he makes his living, one day at a time, as a freelance MechWarrior--selling his services, not to the highest bidder, but to anyone whose contract might lead him closer yet to the insidious Dark Wing Lance.

Herras has tirelessly and obsessively chased down every rumor about the Dark Wing Lance. This quest has led him here, to the planet Galatea, where mercenary MechWarriors and the dregs of the Inner Sphere gather.

But we don't need to tell you this--for you are Herras Ragen.

The object of the game is to conquer 28 islands divided into sectors, with three islands per Epoch and one for the final Epoch. The player must take on the role of one of four Gods: Scarlet (Red), Oberon (Yellow), Caesar (Green) or Madcap (Blue). As their God, the player must lead his or her people by instructing them to do a number of different tasks such as create buildings, design weapons, mine for elements or form an army. The ultimate aim is to defeat all the other Gods by destroying their towers and their people.

There are multiple sectors on each island, and multiple islands spanning different Epochs.

Each sector can be either empty, or be occupied by a particular people. Although the player cannot see before they occupy a sector, each has different types of minerals and elements available to it that can put the occupier at an advantage or disadvantage.

Every island has a differing shape with different numbers of sectors dividing it. Islands in this game can have anywhere between two and sixteen sectors on a four by four grid. Some islands are small enough to only allow two different Gods to play against each other, whilst others are strategically designed for various gameplay scenarios, such as islands that are not connected, requiring flight in the form of jetplanes or biplanes for armies to attack each other.

Epochs determine the base technology level that each group of people begin with. For example, in the 1st Epoch, the starting technology level is equal to that of 9500 BC, meaning that each starting tower resembles a caveman's dwelling. In each Epoch (except the final Epoch) there are three islands and each must be conquered before proceeding to the next. The player may use research to develop along the technology tree, eventually increasing in epoch.

The world's pulse raced with excitement! Everyone truly believed the conniving Dr. Wily had been stopped for good and imprisoned by the valiant Mega Man. Reporters jockeyed with cameramen for snapshots as the infamous Doctor hung his head while being dragged away in handcuffs. Dr. Wily would soon be behind bars. Or would he?

Dr. Wily was ready for anything. He had known his dastardly plans would end in failure someday, so after six months without contact his laboratory sprung to life. Monitors whirred into action, lights flashed, and the lab control panel booted up. In no time four hidden robots emerged. The robots then began a rampage in search of their master. Wily had done it again. Nothing would get in their way!

The world's racing pulse turned to nervous fear as a city was pummeled. Wasn't Dr. Wily in jail? Why was this still happening? The four robots took no heed to the great robot creator Dr. Light. Mega Man found Dr. Light and the canine cyborg Rush fallen in the streets.

"Dr. Light? Are you O.K.?" Mega Man shouted.

"Mega Man! We have no time," replied Dr. Light. "Dr. Wily is using his robots to cover up his escape. You must go! Follow his spaceship!!!"

Mega Man, Dr. Light and Rush looked on in horror as Dr. Wily's spaceship shot out of the prison. Dr. Wily was on the loose!

--From the SNES Mega Man 7 instruction manual.

Overview:

Wily has broken out of prison! It's up to Mega Man to stop him again. This time around he may get some help in the form of the mysterious robot Bass.

Mega Man 7 was the only Mega Man game made for the SNES, and it was quite rare, so few of us (including myself) have played it prior to Console Classix. It plays much like all the Mega Man series, but with better graphics, sound, and controls. 

Directions:

In Mega Man 7 you still have your faithful companion RUSH and of course your trusty Mega Buster. One new thing to the game is you may purchase certain equipment at Eddie's Cybernetic Support Shop at certain times during the game. Well, I will leave it to you to save the world one more time. Good luck with Mega Man 7.

}Different Shade Man Music
For different music for the Shade Man level highlight
his level, press and hold the B button, and then select
his level. You must not have defeated Shade Man
for this to work.
}Get ProtoMan's Shield
First, go to ProtoMan's room in CloudMan's stage (right
before the outdoor part before the boss, there will be
a ladder. Use Rush to get to it). ProtoMan
will comment about using weapons to find areas. Then go
to ProtoMan's room in TurboMan's stage (this one is at
the very top of the area with the traffic
light platforms; go through the wall just before you
reach the top of the ladder). He will mention something
about the Super Adaptor.

After you go to these two rooms (doesn't matter with
order you go to those), go to ShadeMan's stage.
Continue like normal until you reach the Pumpkin
mini-boss. Shoot the small orange core of the Pumpkin
(NOT the eyes on the outside). After you defeat it, it
will open a hole on the bottom. Go down until
you reach the room with a lone green Sniper Joe. Defeat
the Sniper Joe, and instead of going down the ladder,
go right through a secret passage and enter the
gate you find. If you did everything correctly,
ProtoMan will challenge you to a duel.

Once you defeat ProtoMan, he will give you the
ProtoShield. This can be used at the same time as the
MegaBuster (don't forget to select it), and it will
block many enemy shots (like those birds that hatch
from the egg; let all of them run into the shield and
they will die).
}Versus Mode
Enter the following password: 1415 5585 7823 6251
Then press and hold R & L, and push the start button.
After doing so you'll be taken to the Versus Mode
character select screen.

THE JOURNAL OF DR. CAIN

April 10th

I can't believe what I found! Several meters below the surface was the remains of a lab. Although most of the lab was damaged, I did manage to find papers that indicate that it belonged to the famous robot designer, Dr. Thomas Light. I've begun to review what is left of Dr. Light's notes and it looks like he was onto a major breakthrough.

April 14th

Today I met "Mega Man X". Not simply a robot, Mega Man X is something totally different. Light has given him the ability to think and make his own decisions. At times, Mega Man X seems more like a man than like a machine.

November 22nd

With Mega Man X's help I have completed my first "Reploid". Although I don't completely understand how all of Dr. Light's systems work, I was able to make some minor modifications and the Reploid seems to be functioning perfectly. His strength and intelligence seem limitless and he is fully able to make his own decisions. In fact, we got into our first argument. How intriguing!

January 3rd

The new reploids have been running off the assembly line for several weeks. It's amazing how easily they have been able to adapt to even the most difficult jobs. It still is a bit odd to see them working side by side with humans, but everyone seems to be happy to accept them.

February 16th

Three reploids went "maverick" today and injured two people before they were stopped. This is the third instance of this type of behavior and I still have no idea what is causing it! There is some talk about stopping the assembly of any more reploids, but I don't think it will happen. Maybe we've become too dependent on them....

The council has now decided to set up a group of "Hunters" to destroy any maverick before it can cause injury. The reploid named Sigma has been assigned to lead the Hunters. Sigma is one of the most intelligent reploids I've created and contains my latest circuit designs. His systems should be immune to any problems.

June 4th

My worst nightmare has just come true. Sigma went maverick today and took most of the other hunters with him. His motives are unclear, but it seems that he "decided" that humans are inferior and limiting the growth of the Reploids. For that reason, he decided that all humans should be eradicated.

Most of the population is in hiding or trying to flee the city. I'm not sure how long we can hold out against Sigma's forces. I fear I have built the Reploids too well.

Mega Man X is taking the news of the war very personally. He wants to join ZERO, the new leader of the Maverick Hunters, when he goes after Sigma. I'm doubtful of their chances, but I won't stop him. Something has to be done....

--From the SNES Mega Man X instruction manual.

Overview:

This was one of the best games ever made for the SNES. Mega Man X took full advantage of the capabilities of the SNES in the realms of graphics, playability, sound, and controls. It was very simple to play, yet hard to master. Like most Mega Man games there were plenty of secrets to find and lots of weapons to gain (from the sub-bosses of course).

This was also the first game that had Zero. Zero is another robot based on Mega Man X's design who helps in certain parts of the game. Any Mega Man fan should certainly play this game in the series along with Mega man X 2 & 3. 

Directions:

Like most Mega Man games you must lead Mega Man through many sub boss levels in order to get to the head boss. In Mega Man X it is no different.

To have all Turbo Hearts, all Sub-Tanks, and  all Armor Upgrades with no bosses defeated

Zero's Buster
This is done by not getting the arm Power up in Flame mamoth's stage, Go to Sigma stage 1 and when Zero will die he will give you his buster.

Subtank Glitch
Get three sub-tanks and make sure one of your special weapons has less than full power. Then, with the weapon
that has less than full power selected, grab a weapon capsule and immediately hit start. If you did it right, you'll have a fourth sub-tank. Fill it using the same method, just don't over fill or you'll delete it and your third one. It recovers health just like the a normal one.

Mega Man Fireball
Must have Heart Tanks, Sub-Tanks, enemy weapons, and power-ups. Then, go to Armored Armadillo's level. Reach
the final mine cart, which launches you through the air at the end of the level. Just before you reach the wall, jump up and climb the wall. At the top, there will be a large Energy Unit. Get it, and then jump into the pit and die. Repeat this step five times.  On the fifth time through, a capsule will appear on that same ledge. Dr. Light will then give you a Ryu-style fireball for Mega Man to use.

Stage Secrets
Some stages are a little different if you beat a certain boss first. If you beat Chill Penguin, the Lava in Flame Mammoth's stage will be frozen. If you beat Storm Eagle, the lights in Spark Mandrill's stage will flicker on and off. If you beat Launch Octopus, Sting Chameleon's stage will be partially flooded.

Stronger normal shots
Dash while firing your uncharged X-Buster to cause the shot to deal double damage. This is useful when you don't have time to wait for a shot to charge.

"FUTURE TIMES X-TRA! X-TRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT!

Reploid Elimination Not Completed

by Bradbury K. Wells

Times Staff Writer

A new uprising is imminent in the battle to contain the Maverick Reploids that have broken away from their control center. Once believed to be completely contained, these Mavericks have been detected in an abandoned production factory, according to an intelligence report by well-known scientist Dr. Cain.

A special armada of Mavericks Hunters was mobilized today to the production factory, but only one reploid has been able to penetrate the heavy artillery outside the factory.

Known as Mega Man X, this same reploid had been primarily responsible for the apparent elimination of the threat six months ago. According to Dr. Cain's report, now Mega Man X will battle the Mavericks in an attempt to locate and destroy the leader of this new uprising."

--From the SNES Mega Man X 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

This was one of our favorite Mega Man games. The graphics and the gameplay are great as always. Mega Man X 2 was a very popular game in its day but it was still a little tough for CC to find. I think we got lucky and found it at a flea market though. Capcom really knew what they were doing when they made this great title. If you have been living under a rock for the last ten years and somehow managed not to play Mega Man X 2, I suggest you come out from there and give it a try. 

Directions:

Classic Mega Man action! If you've never played a Mega Man game before, I'll give you a bit of a rundown. You must use your weapons to destroy the enemies, especially your main weapon, the Mega Buster, which you can charge up by holding down the shooting button. You'll eventually fight a boss, so you must use different battle strategies to overcome all! You can collect powerups, such as the ones that restore lost energy. Have fun!

Ken's Shoryuken!
Megaman can use Ken's Shoryuken if you get all of the energy tanks, all of the hearts, and all of X's parts.  The capsule for the shoryuken is in the third x-hunter stage (Agile). At one point in his stage, there is a ladder with many bats around. Use the Crystal Hunter to crystallize a bat to reach the ladder.  Follow the path until you reach a downward path. Scroll on the left side of the path until X discovers a passage. You must be at full power for the capsule to appear. Dr. Light will give you Ken's Shoryuken

Disappearing Enemies
This will work with almost any enemy that can be frozen with the Crystal Hunter. Freeze the enemy with a normal shot then pause the game. Now at the pause menu select the X. Buster and hit start. The enemy that was frozen will no longer be there.

Harmless Sigma/Red X-Buster
To do this trick, you must have all of Zero's parts and the Flaming Dragon Punch. First, go to the last Sigma stage. Right before you enter the room where Sigma drops in, stop. Dragon Punch your way in and try to land where Zero will punch his hole after the dialogue. If done correctly, X will fall through the hole when Zero punches it out. When Zero starts talking, do not let his dialogue disappear. Leave it there until X lands in Sigma's room. When Sigma enters, make Zero's dialogue go away and X should be able to walk over to Sigma. Have X stand right by Sigma, and when Sigma begins to fill up his energy meter, Dragon Punch him.

When the fight begins, Sigma should not be able to harm you no matter what he does, making it easy for you to conserve you SubTanks and energy for the second battle. Also, this glitch makes your charged shots look a vibrant reddish-pink color.

It will stay this way until the second Sigma battle begins. Also, using the Giga Crush causes your X-Buster shots to go back to their original color.

Alternate ending screens of Zero
If you don't collect all of Zero's parts and beat the game. You will see a black-armored Zero at the 'Thanks for playing!' screen. But if you collect all of Zero's parts and beat the game, you will see the original Zero at the 'Thanks for playing!' screen instead.

Diagnostics Test
To see the Mega Man X2 diagnostic test, hold the B button on controller 2, then turn on your system. Keep holding until the test appears on screen.

EMERGENCY

Alert! Alert! The DOPPLER research reploid has inspired a revolt in DOPPLER-TOWN. The Maverick VIRUS has broken through the Doppler ANTI-VIRUS, and it appears Doppler has caused it. All previous postings here about the anti-virus are incorrect. The anti-virus is a placebo. REPEAT: THE ANTI-VIRUS IS A PLACEBO!

DopplerTown is over-run with Mavericks. Utopia has ended before it even started. Take cover quickly. Virus is spreading rapidly. Cain Laboratory is being infiltrated. MAVERICK HUNTER UNITS on FULL ALERT. MEGA MAN X and ZERO... mobilize! Grave Danger!

--From the SNES Mega Man X 3 instruction manual.

Overview:

Mega Man X, Zero, and the rest of the Maverick hunters still have more work to do thanks to Dr. Doppler's army of Maverick Robots. Can X and Zero finally destroy all the Mavericks and wipe the Sigma virus from the face of the planet?

Directions:

I strongly suggest you play through Mega Man X before playing Mega Man X3.

In this game you don't have to search for the ability to dash, you have it from the start (If you are using a controller I suggest going into options and changing dash to R or L). Mega Man can fire small, medium, or large charged blasts. The longer you hold the button the more powerful it becomes.

Just jump up against a wall to cling to it. You'll slowly slide down it. If you press jump and push towards the wall you'll be able to climb it. If you press jump and dash from a wall you'll leap to otherwise unreachable areas.

Mega Man X3 adds new upgrades to the mix. Now the dash upgrade lets Mega Man dash left, right, and up when he's in the air. This is an upgrade you NEED. You'll have to find it in Blizzard Buffalo's stage.

During the early levels of the game, you may not have enough power to get through some tough spots, so once every level you may call Zero by going into the menu and press L select (Default L) to pop up the COM window. Press A to call Zero. Zero will leave when he comes up against a boss door. If Zero is killed he is dead for the rest of the game and cannot be called again.

Need even more firepower? Those X platforms spread throughout the game let you call on Mechs you've collected in other levels. To be able to use these X platforms, you'll need to get the Chimera Armor in Blast Hornet's Stage. It's hidden well, you'll need the Tunnel Fang to find it. 

Controls:

A Button - Dash
B Button - Jump
X Button - Nothing
Y Button - Shoot
L Button - Select Weapon
R Button - Select Weapon
Start Button - Menu
Select Button - Nothing

Hints:

Golden Armor
To get the Super Golden Armor, you must destroy all the bosses (that means you have to kill Bit, Byte, and Vile with the weapons they are weak against) as well as collect all the upgrades, energy tanks, heart tanks, mechs, and NOT GET ANY upgrade CHIPS. While going through Doppler's fortress you'll meet an acid spitting boss. Defeat him and proceed. KEEP YOUR HEALTH HIGH. You have to have max health to get the upgrade. The first pit you come up to slide down, holding onto the left wall. You'll find a secret passage, and if you did everything right you'll see the capsule for the Golden Armor. Now you have all the Chip powers instead of just one.

Z Sabre
To equip X with the Z Sabre, you have to destroy Vile (you MUST kill him with his weakness). Zero must be alive, and you must not use him too early in Doppler's second stage. In Doppler's second stage, right after the water part you will see a boss door. Change to Zero and go in and fight the boss. Zero will give X his sabre whether he wins or looses. Use it like you would with Zero. Charge up till you're green, fire two charged shots, and the third will be the sabre. The Sabre strike can kill any boss in two hits. 

Tips:

Code
All armor parts, all enemy skills, all sub-tanks, all heart tanks, all ride armors and no enhance chip aquire, so you can still have the change to obtain the gold armor in doppler stage. The stage start at where Doppler stage just shown out at the MAP selection screen

CHAOS AT THE SOCCER STADIUM

In the near future the day had come for the big showdown between the two best soccer teams in the nation. A wide television audience was expected in addition to the large crowd that had already assembled at the stadium.

As the teams took the field an uneasy feeling fell over the crowd. Suddenly, bursts of fire pelted the stadium and the field was engulfed in smoke. The crowd gazed in amazement as the smoke cleared to reveal that the players had been replaced by highly familiar robots running out onto the field. It seemed the robots were going to play the game instead.

The television audience was especially surprised at the events. The most surprised person was the one and only Dr. Light, who immediately recognized the robots and knew Dr. Wily had to be up to his old tricks. This is unexpected, Dr. Light thought. That's probably what Dr. Wily is thinking: no one will notice when my robots take control of the world through its most popular sport. Think again Dr. Wily, here comes MEGA MAN!

Dr. Light brought to life a reserve of blue crime-fighting robots with the trusty Mega Man leading them. The next great robot showdown will be on the soccer field. No matter where Dr. Wily's diabolical plots occur Mega Man will be there to battle through the robots and get Dr. Wily.

REBIRTH OF THE 21st CENTURY

As the 21st century dawned and society ignored the warning signs of social unrest and tamperings with nature, crime, riots, and food shortages became commonplace. Cities soon dissolved into ruins and were divided and run as armed camps. As earthquakes and flooding devastated the remaining great cities, all seemed to be lost. In this world of anarchy, human life was filled with violence, hatred and hopelessness. Soon, the only source of amusement became the Battle Game.

Advanced technology in weapons systems, armament and hydraulics were twisted to create a vehicle designed solely to compete in arena style combat. The first of these were little more than old army tanks outfitted with updated weapons systems. As pursuit of this new sport progressed, advanced designs with humanoid shapes soon began to appear. Originally called "Standing Tanks," they soon came to be called simply "ST." Typical combat between these metal monsters consisted of two STs facing off and firing their weapons at each other until only one was left standing. Victory meant power and prestige. Defeat meant that the loser would become a second-citizen, forced to serve the victors.

Not all accepted the Battle Game's class system. One young man, Mike Anderson, refused to live by the station being forced on him by this father's defeat in the Battle Game. Determined to seek vengeance on the fighter who had defeated his father, Mike dedicated his life to learning all he could about the technology of the STs

While Mike trained, Anubis, the fighter who had defeated his father, continued to win even more power fighting in hi ST Thanatos. As he took control, Anubis promoted the best fighters in the Battle Game to be his "Chiefs." Along with this title, each was given control over a portion of the earth.

Upon completion of his self imposed training, Mike undertook a most dangerous goal: to battle through Anubis' Chiefs and take on the one who had declared himself Emperor, Anubis.

Three years have passed since Anubis suffered defeat at the hand of Mike Anderson. A new age of prosperity has begun to emerge, and along with it, the rebirth of some of the earth's great cities. Just as quickly as he disappeared following his defeat, Anubis has reappeared to resume his tyranny. Again you must join Mike and attempt to crush the iron rule of Anubis before he can once more throw earth back into the darkest of ages.

--From the SNES Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge instruction manual.

Metal Morph is a video game developed by Origin Systems and published by FCI, Inc. for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The gameplay alternated between run and gun and scrolling shooter (playing as a space ship). Both the player character and his space ship are able to use MetalMorphosis (a fictional transformation ability unique to the game) to navigate certain areas. The player must retrieve missing pieces of the ship, while simultaneously fending off aliens who desire the secret of MetalMorphosis.

Metal Warriors
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1995
Developer: LucasArts
Publisher: Konami
_________________________
*
Metal Warriors is about the United government in the year 2102 being under siege from Dark Axis led by the leader Venkar Amon. The few remaining warriors defending Earth would be known as the Metal Warriors.

After successfully completing a few missions in space: rescuing a scientist, gathering intelligence, defending a ship and capturing a mining facility, the United government disables a anti-spacecraft canon in the Colorado mountains in order to safely begin removing axis forces from earth. Missions on Earth include assaulting a facility in the jungle, fighting through bombed out cities and capturing deep-earth mining facilities. Finally, the player confronts Amon and defeats him in a battle between fully mobile flying armored suits.

Gameplay: 

Much of the game mechanics fall inline with a platform game. On top of the regular single player game, the addition of a 2 player split screen mode did add value to the title. Most notably each selectable robot has their own melee weapons in the game.

The gameplay mechanics and level design are very similar to Assault Suits Valken/Cybernator, but this game is not a sequel to Cybernator as many users tend to believe. Cybernator and Metal Warriors are completely different games made by different companies.The confusion comes from the fact of Konami being the publisher of both games for the US.

The game notably made use of each of the Super Nintendo's buttons: The D-Pad would move the player's mech, L would activate power-ups, Select would eject the pilot/enter a mech, Start paused the game, R would activate defenses, Y was the basic ranged weapon, A was the melee weapon, B was movement, and X was tied to a unique ability. (This was not the case for the Drache.)

Tips:

Beat the game without using any continues
Basketball mode (????? on Title Screen)

Get to and beat Mission 7 w/o using a continue.
Secret Mission, The Tower

This is a complete Super Metroid hack, that alone makes it worth playing. It features new maps, layouts, item placements, and enemy placements. The areas in the beginning are similar to the originals, the farther you advance the more it changes. The difficulty is about the same as the original, and the puzzles are decent. There is a minor glitch where parts of the map won't be displayed when reloading your save.

Mick & Mack was a McDonald's liscensed game developed by David Perry at Virgin Games. It appeared on various Sega systems and the Amiga, though they cancelled the snes version. It is a simple platform shooter game. The game was shown at the Winter 1993 CES.

A prototype rom image of this game shows that it was at a beta state at the very least for the snes. When you first load the rom, there is a bunch of debug stuff, which allows you to choose various levels. The levels seem to be pretty much complete, but there isn't really much you can do. Most enemies are static and do not harm your character. You can also use the L button to float around the levels, which is very necessary since pits do not kill you. Pressing the R button skips you to the bonus stages for each level.

Mickey and Donald: Magical Adventure 3
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer , Side-Scrolling
Release Year: 2004
Players: 1
Original Title: Mickey to Donald: Magical Adventure 3
Translated By: RPGONE
Version: 1.1
_________________________
*
Mickey and Donald - Magical Adventure 3 is the third series in the Disney-inspired platormers made by Capcom in the 1990's. The game plays just like The Magical Quest and The Great Circus Mystery: Go through levels, gain new costumes that empower you with new skills, repeat.

The game begins with Mickey and Donald playing with Huey, Louie and Dewey, but the three kids piss off Donald, which makes them run away in fear. They hide in the attic, where they find a book which absorbs them. Rather, King Pete decides to kidnap them and make them his slaves. Some imagery. Once Mickey and Donald find out about this, a fairy shows up and sends them into the book to find the nephews and stop King Pete.

The game is pretty damn good, the graphics and music are awesome, too. And you can choose between Mickey or Donald, which is fun if you prefer one over the other. The only bad thing is that Mickey gets the best gear, while Donald gets the crappy stuff. For example, Mickey gets some awesome armor. What does Donald get? A wooden barrel, a bucket, and a wooden hammer. Poor, poor Donald. I didn't play through the entire game, but you can get an armor, some tree-climbing equipment (which is similar to the mountain climbing gear you get in part two), and a magic lamp. Weird. But fun. The game might be a bit easy for some folks, though. But it's still pretty fun to seek out all hidden life containers and bonus games in there.

Translation Description:

The version 1.1 patch still translates everything, and it fixes some grammar and contextual errors. The game is translated into British English, so be on the lookout for favours and armours as you play the game. I'm sure you won't mind. I didn't.

Like many other games of its genre, the player takes the role of Mickey and progresses through each level, defeating enemies in the way and solving the occasional puzzle. Most enemies can be defeated by jumping on them or throwing marbles at them. Frequently, the player must jump from platform to platform to advance, sometimes with a time limit (such as escaping a collapsing tower).

Game History:

Originally, Mickey Mania was planned as a game to be released as part of Mickey's 65th birthday. However, as that would have only allowed 6 months to develop the game, this idea was soon scrapped in favor of the more compelling concept of Mickey travelling back to his original cartoons. It pays tribute to Mickey's career (and was released in 1994, the year after Mickey's 65th birthday).

Tips:

Level select
Go to the Sound Test menu, set music to Beanstalk 1 and SFX to Extra Try, highlight Exit and hold L until you hear the jingle.

This game was completed, and I had the chance to chat with Eric Browning about the it:

Mickey never saw the light of day. It was complete, I can't remember what happened. I tried animating Mickey- but Disney does not mess around with that guy and I simply am not trained as an animator. We sent it to Little Gangsters in L.A, an animation house Disney worked with. They did amazing animation- I was humbled by that.

I got a ROM of Mickey, wow, I've come a long way. Pretty neat to see it, I remember every little pixel. The animation isn't as good as I remember, partly due to my inexperience and in large part because I think the programmer was forced to remove frames.

First, you choose whether to play as Mickey or Minnie, and then you choose from three difficulty levels. The player then learns of trouble in Beanswick. There is a strange rumbling over the castle and no one can explain it. Mickey (or Minnie) volunteers to investigate. He must go through a series of challenges in various rooms of the castle in order to collect magic beans and items. These tasks can be completed in any order, but all must be finished to beat the game.

The land of CRON is facing many problems brought on by the encroachment of Sheltem and once again the adventurers must travel through CRON, the four elemental planes and even through time to help Corak stop Sheltem from flinging CRON into its sun.

While in many ways Might and Magic 2 is an updated version of the original, the improved graphics help greatly with navigation, and the interface added several functions that facilitated gameplay, such as a "delay" selector which allowed for faster or slower response times, and a spinning cursor when input was required- all features lacking in Might and Magic 1.

GO GO POWER RANGERS! Based on the hit 90's live action show, an evil sorceress by the name of Rita Repulsa has come to conquer Earth. A wise wizard, Zordon, and his faithful robot assistant Alpha 5, knew that they would have to give the legendary power to five young people... teenagers with attitude. Only Jason the Red Ranger, Billy the Blue Ranger, Zack the Black Ranger, Kimberly the Pink Ranger, and Trini the Yellow Ranger can stop Rita and thwart her evil plans once and for all.

I fondly remember the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, and playing this game helps to relive those childhood memories. Just the opening screen, when you see the logo and hear the theme blaring, you know you're in for something good. Each of the heroes is well detailed in the game, each with their own style of combo hits, weapons, and appearances when unmorphed. Each ranger looks figuratively the same in their suits which may draw some frowns, though, even if it isn't that big of a deal. Every stage in the game, from Downtown California to the Sewers, sets the mood with choices of color and types of enemies you encounter. The sound is done well, the theme song at the beginning is pretty clear for an SNES game, lyrics and all, and the music in each stage really adds that extra boost of excitement while you play. If you're an old fan, this game is right up your alley. If you're just an average gamer who isn't quite familiar with the show, give it a try and see how you like it.

Directions:

You can choose from 5 different characters: Jason, Billy, Zach, Kimberly, and Trini. Now, while each one has different ways to fight, the way they are executed are all the same. Pressing the punch button repeatedly does a combo that's useful against the stronger baddies you take on.

Usually one combo of attacks can destroy a purple Putty, even if the combo involves more striking than others.

It'll start simply enough: the weaker Putties, the foot-soldiers of Rita, will come, and taking them out is easy enough. Then it gets to stronger Putties, to spiders, and more.

You start off in a civilian form, but when you come to a place in the level where you encounter a boss for the first time, you morph into your character's respective Ranger form. You also earn refilled health when you do this, which can be a big help. Even so, items such as health kits and food are scattered about and help in the same way. Each Power Ranger also has their own personal weapon, such as Red with the Power Sword and Pink with her Power Bow. In case you feel overwhelmed by enemies, you can break out a special power up. This unleashes a bomb type of attack which will eliminate the lesser enemies and deal serious damage to a boss. Don't worry about it being gone forever; if you use your special attack early on, you might come across a canister that holds another. When you get to said boss at the end of each stage, be ready and find out their style so you'll be able to outsmart their fighting patterns. 

Controls:

B Button - Jump
Y Button - Punch, push repeatedly to do a combo attack
Start Button - Pause/Unpause
Up and Y - Special Attack (BOMB)
Down and Y - Low Kick

Ivan Ooze is taking over the world, starting with Angel Grove, and it's up to the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers to stop him. Run through the streets of Angel Grove fighting putties, robots, and Ooze men. Only you can save the world from this horrible menace.

Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie is a fun game and worth playing. It features good graphics which include morphing, enemies, and backgrounds. The music keeps with the traditional soundtrack of the TV series. This game, however, doesn't exactly follow the movie as far as Ninja Rangers or new Zords. It does keep somewhat with the story-line as far as Ivan Ooze being the bad guy, and the Ooze men. Come to think about it, that's about it. This game remains, however, a fun and entertaining game, so give it a chance and play it. Sit down, Log in, and have fun!

Directions:

Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: the Movie is a fun side-scrolling Beat-em-up game that brings all the fun of the Movie and the TV series to the game screen. Choose which of the rangers you want to play as: Tommy, Billy, Rocky, Kimberly, Aisha, or Adam, and then run through the streets beating up on the bad guys.

This game lets you play on 1 player and take on the world by yourself; or a 2 player mode, which lets you fight side by side to save the world from Ivan Ooze!

In most sections of the game, the screen is divided into two different areas, for example the street and the sidewalk. Press the L or R buttons to switch between these areas. Note that you can sometimes use this to avoid enemies, but they will sometimes follow you if you switch.

Along the way, you can pick up Power Bolts from fallen enemies, which increase your power bar on the bottom of the screen. Pressing "X" before the power bar is full shoots a ball of energy at the enemies. Pressing "X" when your power bar is full will morph you into a Ranger, which gives you a more powerful attack. Filling the power bar again will give you use of the Ranger's special weapon, such as Rocky's sword, Billy's staff, Kimberly's bow, Adam's Axe, and Aisha's sais. Also, along the way you can break capsules which contain big power bolts (that give you a lot of power) or food which increase your health (located on the bottom left of the screen).

Run through all seven levels, which start on the streets of Angel Grove and end in Ivan's Ooze Fortress, and fight the bosses at the end, such as Mirror Maniac, Cannon Top, Skelerena, Magnet Brain, Silver Horns, Main Frame, and finally Ivan Ooze. The last two before Ivan Ooze are large and require a strategy, as opposed to the ones before, which are more or less beat-em-up and avoid getting hit. Ivan Ooze is actually two bosses, with the first fight being the same size as the rangers. The last fight with Ivan, he grows huge and requires a strategy to defeat.

No matter which Ranger you pick, you only get three lives and four continues. After using a continue, you are given the chance to choose a new Ranger or stick with the one you had. Defeat Ivan Ooze and save the world, it's as simple as that. Good Luck, Gamer.

How do you defeat these creatures that block your path, you ask? You throw candy at them! And they eat the candy, and they eat contentedly, and that's your chance to slip by, as they chew merrily on the mysterious free candy! And then there's these platforms that plummet to the ground the second you step on them and you die and the end.

Well, this is a fighting game. It's based on an anime. Not beingthe anime fanboy I once was, I am no longer blinded when playing a crappy video game just because it has an anime license.

This game is pretty horrible. It's SLOW. Aren't fighting games supposed to be full of high-speed action? Shouldn't Chun Li be flying around the screen faster than your eye can register? She should. But no, in Mobile Gundam yadayada, we are stuck with mechas that move like Betty White with a case of rickets.

There's hardly any variety in special moves; just the usual assortment of Street Fighter rip-offs, just much less cool-looking than their Capcom-inspired counterparts. Oh! And in story mode there's only like five playable characters.

Anyway, on a scale from Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle to Street Fighter II Turbo, I give this game a solid rank of Tough E Nuff.

Translation Description:

GIdeon took this game on as an exercise in changing font widths, and as this patch demonstrates, he was successful. The translation for the story mode text was handled quite well by Alexander Beetle, and should be an enjoyable to read. Unfortunately, if you made it this far down the page, you've already read my game review, and know that is a really horrible game. So, you may never see those keen translations.

Tips:

Use Devil Gundam
At the Character Select Screen, highlight any Gundam, then hold L + R+Select + Start and press A.

Using God Gundam in Story Mode
Pick Shining Gundam as your fighter in Story Mode, then lose a couple of times (as in the whole fight, not just a round in a fight), and God Gundam will automatically replace Shining Gundam as your character.

There seem to be no issues so far. The game's script was translated by vampiresquid, and the title screen was done by yours truly. It's difficult to read the dialogue at times, but it's the programmer's fault, not Gideon's.

I'm not sure if you can call this a game.

This is another Gundam game, but unlike its brethren, this is not a strategy game, but more of a side-scrolling adventure. Except you can barely control your mech, you have very limited ammo, you can't jump, you only have a flimsy shield to protect yourself, and oh yeah, two enemy mechs will come at you from both sides, so even if you're defending your front, your back is wide open.

No pun intended there, folks, but that's what happened to me. I had a forcible entry expert there.

In short, I don't like this game. The end.

...

Well okay, the graphics are pretty.

Translation Description:

This one looks to be finally complete with some nice hacking work from RedComet. Enjoy some 100% complete V Gundam action.

The aim of each level is to collect enough CDs in order to open the exit to the next level. The CD number in the top left-hand corner will sound an alert and begin flashing when the required number has been reached. The exit appears on the map as a flashing X (not to be confused with the player's current location) after the required number of CDs has been reached. There are different coloured CDs worth a different amount of points, as well as large CDs that can be collected that unlock different audio tracks (the final one being Elephant Funk). Every second level ends with a boss, and will lead to a different world upon completion.

Mohawk's health is represented by yellow triangles and each time he is hit by an enemy, the number will go down (maximum of five). However, spikes bring instant death like in most classic video games. He can also collect floating balls (maximum of 3) which allow him to explode, killing all enemies on screen. There are also a variety of forms Mohawk can become including wheelie, springs, angel and mer-hawk.

Do not pass go, do not collect $200. How many of us have heard these words while playing the classic board game? Well, the wonderful game of getting money is now a similarly classic video game. Choose from your favorite game pieces to run around the board and collect property, all the while trying to bankrupt the other players.

Monopoly is a fun game that will have you playing for hours. The graphics of this game are good, with a cartoonish feel to them except for an almost realistic hand that rolls the dice. The music is good, but mostly during gameplay there is no music. All in all this is a fun game that brings in all the aspects of the classic board game.

Directions:

Monopoly is almost exactly like the board game it is modeled after. You choose your game piece and the number of opponents. Now you're ready to play. Roll the dice and traverse the board, which is just like the actual game-board from the board game, collecting property, paying taxes, and getting Chance and Community Chest cards. From the game menu you have the option to buy and sell houses and hotels, mortgage and unmortgage property, and trade with the other players. During normal gameplay you can push the "Y" button to view what properties have been bought already and by whom. Get money and bankrupt the other players in this game of high-stakes business. Have fun!

Monstania is one of those kick-ass games that never got translated. I seriously don't see what the powers that be had against this game, except maybe it's short length. The graphics are impressive, the sound is great (with music by Lunar and Grandia god Noriyuki Iwadare), the story is pretty entertaining, and the gameplay is certainly there.

Anyway, the game revolves around young Fron, who with the help of his sweetheart, Tia, is in search of the whereabouts of the thought-to-be-extinct fairies. You pretty much sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds, until you encounter the enemy, where you fight them in a semi-realtime strategy environment (i.e., the monsters only attack while you move). In many ways, the battle system is somewhat similar to Azure Dream's battle system for PSX.

Translation Description:

This is a superb translation of a superb game, and it comes highly recommended.

For ages it was a tournament of honor and glory. Noble warriors from around the world we invited to take part, each seeking to win the title of Grand Champion.

But that was a long time ago... Before the tournament was corrupted by the evil demon Shang Tsung, a warrior who took not only the lives of his opponents, but their very souls...

With the aid of his pupil, Goro, a hideous half-human dragon, Tsung began a domination of the contest which has lasted for centuries. Today, 500 years later, the contest begins anew as warriors once again gather to partake in Mortal Kombat.

Let The Tournament Begin!

--From the SNES Mortal Kombat instruction manual.

Overview:

The story isn't very important, but the fighting is. You start with the main menu that lets you choose between Tournament and Options. Tournament gets you to the action, and Options lets you set up the game to your liking. After selecting Tournament, you get to select between seven great fighters: Johnny Cage, Kano, Raiden, Liu Kang, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Sonya. The game goes through the ladder from a random playable character to the all-powerful Shang Tsung.

Mortal Kombat is a decent game that I really enjoyed, but I'm improving since the first time I played. The bad thing about it is that the blood was replaced with sweat because Nintendo used to have a policy that only allowed "family-friendly" games. The Genesis and arcade versions have blood in them. Fortunately, when the ESRB ratings started, all versions of MK2 and later have blood in them. 

Directions:

Fight to the bloody death in this start of a very popular series. During battle, you have to punch and kick the other guy to get his life down to red. On the final round, the winner can perform a fatality on the loser, which involves the winner performing a very violent act. If you want two players, the second player can press Start at the character selection screen.

Controls:

A Button - Low Kick
B Button - Low Punch
X Button - High Kick
Y Button - High Punch
L Button - Block
R Button - Block
Start Button - Start Game
Select Button - Nothing

Hints:

Change Sweat Into Blood
This is a Game Genie code. To use it press Escape, click on Cheat, and Add Code. Where it says "Enter Code", type in BDB4-DD07 (with the dash), put in a description, and click on "Add". Repeat for DDB4-DFA7 using the same description. Close the "Cheat" box in ZSNES and reset the game.

Tips:

Start with 10 Credits (Japanese version)
This code only works in the Japanese version that originally starts with 4 Credits. At the Acclaim logo screen when Goro appears, press Left, Up, Right, Up, Left, and Up. You will hear a sound right when the screen fades away after the code is entered correctly that allows you to start with 10 Credits.

Goro Glitch
Perform Rayden's fatality on the third endurance stage in a one player game. Goro will appear silver colored and flashing.

How to attack Goro without making him unfreeze
It's possible to hit Goro without making him unfreeze!  First, use Sub Zero's ice blast attack to freeze Goro. Now, quickly run up to Goro and do a few (3) sweeps. (Back + low kick) This attack does not make Goro unfreeze! However, do not be too greedy and try more than 3 sweeps on Goro as he can simply unfreeze by time.  To maximize damage after freezing Goro, sweep him 3 times and than do an Uppercut attack! (down + Hard Punch)

After being defeated more times than he would like, the Emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn, puts a 10,000 year old plan into effect. Sending Shang Tsung to Earthrealm to resurrect his dead queen, Sindal, the emperor then merges Earthrealm with Outworld to retrieve her. Thousands of people are killed instantly, except for those few souls that Raiden protects to fight to save Earthrealm. Now it is up to these few warriors to save their once beloved planet. Good Luck!

Mortal Kombat 3 is, as you guessed, the third installment of the Mortal Kombat series. The game is as fun as its two predecessors, with the same realistic graphics and heart pumping music. This version, however, was subject to wide-spread criticism due to the fighting stages not being set in a fantasy realm like the last games, and also due to the lack of several of the classic characters such as Scorpion and Kitana. The game, however, is just as entertaining as the last two, and in my opinion features more realistic graphics and better music.

Directions:

Mortal Kombat 3 is the third installment of the famed fighting series. Much like the last two games, this game has the same premise, with warriors from Earthrealm fighting in a tournament to save their planet.

To get started is simple, choose one of the many characters such as Cyrax, Kabal, Nightwolf, Sektor, Sheeva, Stryker, Liu Kang, Kano, Kung Lao, Jax, Shang Tsung, Smoke, Sonja Blade, and Sub-Zero. Then fight your way past the other characters and the two bosses, Motaro and Shao Kahn. After that you'll have beaten the game. Before fighting you can enter the options page and change the difficulty and even give yourself a handicap. That's pretty much the game in a nutshell. So sit down, Log in, and Have fun.

NOTHING, NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU!

500 years ago, the shapeshifter Shang Tsung was banished from the Outworld to the Mother Realm (Earth) for his crimes. There, with the aid of his pupil Goro, a hideous half-human dragon, he was to atone for his crimes by unbalancing the furies of the realm, allowing his master Shao Kahn and his minions to enter the dominion and rule forever.

He was defeated.

He returned to Outworld a failure, facing execution at the hands of Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of the Outworld, the Astral Planes of Shokan and the surrounding kingdoms. With the apparent demise of Goro, his fate seemed sealed. But Tsung told Kahn of his plan for revenge, a plot so evil and twisted even Kahn was persuaded to grant him one final opportunity to redeem himself. He cleverly lured his adversaries to the bizarre Outworld where they would face a new challenge-- a tournament hosted by Shao Kahn himself.

Today, the Tournament Begins... Again!

--From the SNES Mortal Kombat 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

After his defeat in the first tournament, Shang Tsung crawls back to his master, Shao Kahn, and begs for his life. Shang Tsung tells his master of a new plan to take over Earth realm. Shao Kahn returns Shang Tsung's youth and calls forth to the realms to have another tournament, this time in Outworld. Now all the warriors gather and get ready to fight for their homes. Now it is time, once again, for MORTAL KOMBAT!!! (cue techno music)

Mortal Kombat 2 is the sensational sequel to the famous fighting game, with realistic graphics and fighting styles. They looked great on the SNES and every other console these games appeared on. Mortal Kombat was the first game to use real actors as the characters rather then using 8 or 16 bit graphics. The music in this game keeps your heart pumping and ready to fight. This game is highly popular and highly recommended for the fan of the fighting game.

Directions:

Much like the first game, Mortal Kombat 2 is an action packed fighting game that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Play one player and fight your way through to Shao Kahn and save the world, or play with a friend and beat the ever living snot out of each other. To get started is simple: just choose from one of the many playable characters there are to choose from, such as Baraka, Jax, Kitana, Kung Lao, Mileena, Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, Raiden, Reptile, Scorpion, Sub-zero, and Shang Tsung. Each one uses pretty much the same moves, except for their special moves which are usually some sort of projectile made by a combination of directions plus a high or low punch. Fight your way through all characters and the two bosses, Kintaro and Shao Kahn, to beat the game. So sit down, log in, and have fun.

The player starts in qualifying, and as he/she plays the game more frequently, he/she can qualify for the regionals, nationals, the championship, and the grueling final race where he/she must get first place in order to beat the game. Players will spend literally hours in the easier modes and this game is like exercise for his/her thumbs.

There are a selection of cyclists, including a demon, a California surfer, and a ninja. Each character has a different catch phrase for winning, being in first, being in second, being in third, and everything in between. The only violence in this game comes from the onlookers who throw objects at the bikers to cause damage. Even after being hit several times, the bike is never destroyed. Finding a repair bonus on the track can fix the damage and make the bicycle run faster again. There are also bonuses on the track for points and energy, which gives the player more strength to push his/her bicycle to the limits.

Limitations:

When playing this game on an emulator, it is sometimes necessary to reset the emulator, as the game can sometimes freeze up on the name entry screen. Unlike most games, game time is not faster than real time and 10 minutes on a bike in the game is actually 10 minutes in real life. This special effect was originally intended for players to do on their specialized exercise equipment which had to be bought separately, although the game still worked with the normal Super NES controllers.

Mr Bloopy is an unreleased game by Rare. DreamTR managed go aquire a prototype of this game. It is a puzzle-oriented platform game. Before this find, this game was completely unknown. Here is what DreamTR had to say about the game:

It's a puzzle side scroller. You can change colors by pressing various buttons, you shoot droplets out, and you have to put picture puzzle pieces in proper places. A very peculiar game. 

As I mentioned before, this game is a complete mystery. Perhaps someone who worked at Rare could clarify this?

Mr. Do!
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Puzzle
Release Year: 1996
Developer: Imagineer
Publisher: Black Pearl Software
_________________________
*
The object of Mr. Do! is to score as many points as possible by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries.  The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown), is constantly chased by red monsters resembling small dinosaurs, and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by a monster.  The game is over when the last life is lost.

Cherries are distributed throughout the level in groups of eight.  500 bonus points are awarded if Mr. Do collects eight cherries in a row without stopping.  A level is complete when all cherries are removed or all monsters are destroyed.

Mr. Do can defeat the monsters by hitting them with his bouncing "power ball" or by dropping large apples on them.  While the power ball is bouncing toward a monster, Mr. Do is defenseless, leaving him vulnerable.  If the ball bounces into an area where there are no monsters to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it.  When the power ball hits a monster, it then reforms in Mr. Do's hands after a delay that increases with each use.

If an apple lands on a monster or falls more than its own height, it breaks and disappears.  If an apple drops a short distance and does not break, Mr. Do or the red monsters can push it off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more monsters.  Mr. Do can also be crushed by a falling apple.

Occasionally, the red monsters transform briefly into slower, more powerful multicolored monsters that can tunnel through the ground.  If one of these digs through a cherry, it leaves fewer cherries (and fewer points) for Mr. Do to collect.  When it digs under an apple, it often crushes itself, other red/blue monsters, and/or Mr. Do.

Each time the score passes a certain threshold during play (5000 points), a letter from the word "EXTRA" appears on the playfield as an Alphamonster, and the player can defeat or be defeated by this monster in the same way as a red monster.  Defeating an Alphamonster awards that letter to the player, and collecting all five letters of the word completes the level, plays a cut scene playing the theme to Astro Boy, and awards the player an extra life.  Alphamonsters eat any apples they encounter, which makes them difficult (but not impossible) to crush.

The red monsters pop up from a generator at the center of the screen. After they have all appeared, the generator will turn into a food item; picking this up scores bonus points, freezes all the red monsters, and calls out an Alphamonster and three large blue monsters. The latter can eat apples as well. The red monsters stay frozen (but still deadly) until the player either defeats the Alphamonster, defeats all three blue monsters, loses a life, or completes the stage.

Rarely, dropping an apple will reveal a diamond which, if collected within about 30 seconds, completes the level and awards a bonus credit to the player (as well as 8000 points), allowing him or her to play a free game.  (This feature is relatively uncommon among arcade video games, though it is a standard feature of many pinball machines.)

Oh no! The evil Yeti is trying to freeze the world and turn it into a frozen nightmare. Grab your nuts and leap into action to stop the abominable snowman, Mr. Blizzard. Don't let this little red squirrel fool you, he is a lean, mean, nut flinging machine.

Mr. Nutz is a fun platform game that takes a whole new meaning to Bright-eyed and Bushy-tailed. With awesome graphics that even show you the buzzing wings of the bees and the juice that flies out of the berries. The music of this game is zany and funny, which keeps up the mood of the game. All in all, this game is fun and worth playing.

Directions:

Mr. Nutz is an action platform game that takes you through six areas of zany fun. Jump on your enemies or use your tail to whip them. Also along you way you will find acorns that you can hurl at your enemies. Collect coins to raise your score and get more lives. Be sure to keep an eye on your health which is in the upper left hand corner of the screen, along with your number of lives and the number of acorns you have. Run through six levels to get to Mr. Blizzard and stop him from freezing the world. At the end of each level is one of Mr. Blizzard's henchmen, such as Mr. Spider, the Vulture Witch, the Octopus, the Giant and the Clown. So get crackin' and stop the evil Yeti from carrying out his plan. Good Luck.

Genre: Platformer
Release Year: Unreleased
Developer: Sales Curve Interactive
_________________________
*
Mr. Tuff is a 2D platform game in development by Sales Curve Interactive (SCI) and presumably set to be published by Ocean in 1994-1995. The game was done by the same people as Super SWIV, and as such, the graphics are incredibly polished. The game was apparently too ambitious, and was never fully complete (although the game engine and graphics certainly indicate that it is close).

The game follows a demolition robot known as Mr. Tuff. After the entire population of earth escapes to the planet Utopia, the army robots take over the world. It is up to Mr. Tuff to save the world for the peaceful domestic robots. The levels involve standard platform action, though there are a few shooter-esce hoverboard levels. Each world is set up into standard levels and a boss level.

There are two known prototype roms for this game. As far as I can tell, they are pretty similar in terms completion. The "Lost Levels" prototype, which I am releasing here, is less complete. The title screen has a date of July 12, 1994 and is stated to be version 0.90. The game is apparently optimized to be PAL, and is not explicitly programmed to be detected. So, if you play this game in an emulator without forcing PAL, it will appear to run too fast. Some of the sound effects aren't programmed in yet, and there are some areas where there are more enemies than in the later beta. 

The source of the later beta is not precisely known at this time. It fixes the PAL issue and some of the sound glitches. If you want to play this game more, the later beta is the way to go

I've played through the first two worlds in this game, and it the game seems quite close to completion. The password system is not in operation, so using save states is a must, as your health doesn't reset between stages. The control system works well, so the challenge comes from getting the enemies before they get you. There have certainly been worse games released. It seems as if this one may have been delayed a bit too much and the publishers did not want to release it with the heavy competition in the 2D platform market.

Ms. Pac-Man
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Maze
Release Year: 1996
Developer: Digital Eclipse Software
Publisher: Williams Entertainment
_________________________
*
Ms. Pac-Man gets to run around in 36 unique, mind-boggling mazes, some small enough to fit on one screen; some so big you'll have to scroll around; some that are mighty strange; and some that are straight out of the arcades!

Whether you're a beginner or expert, Ms Pac-Man will have you running ragged. There's even a Pac Booster Button to really let her shake-off those pesky ghosts.

--From the SNES Ms. Pac-Man instruction manual.

Overview:

Another great update of the Pac-Man series. Ms. Pac-Man wakka-wakkas around the maze eating dots and dodging ghosts, or chasing the ghosts when she eats a Power Pellet. Great graphics and sound make this an excellent choice in the Pac-Man line.

This is one of the most awesome looking Pac-Man games around, with several different kinds of mazes, and you get to choose which you want to play! It also has the great cut scenes every few levels that we all love. The stages are colorful and have strange and unique designs that are different from what you might be used to. The noises and music are just what you'd expect them to be for a Pac-Man game.

This is definitely one of my favorite games and it is very addictive!

Directions:

Guide Ms. Pac-Man around all kinds of different mazes, eating all of the little dots. Just be careful that you don't get eaten by a ghost yourself! Turn the tables on the ghosts by grabbing a Power Pellet, which is larger than the rest.

When you eat a Power Pellet the ghosts will all change from their normal differing colors to a bright blue. Their expressions also change to white simplified squiggles. Quick! While they're like that eat as many as you can for extra points! When you've eaten one it will turn into just eye-balls that run around the screen until they make it back into the center box, where it will turn back into whichever ghost it originally was. When the Power Pellet is about to wear off, the ghosts will begin to flash white. Use the wrap-around holes in the sides of the maze to move from one side to the opposite side in a flash, but watch out. You can easily run into a ghost who is on the other side.

This version of Ms. Pac-Man has difficulty settings ranging from Easy, which is pretty easy, to Crazy, which is exactly that. Also, you can choose from several maze sets, including Arcade, Big, Mini, and Strange (my favorite!). All of them will have completely different looks, but be careful in the Strange ones because some places may look like you can fit through but you can't! Also a cool option in this version, you can speed Ms. Pac-Man up by using the Pac-Booster. You can turn it on and off by pressing A or B, or have it always on or always off. Just pick the setting you prefer in the Options menu.

Pick up all kinds of fruit (and a pretzel) for lots of extra points. The fruit will come bouncing into the stage from one of the wrap-around portals. You will easily be able to tell when one has come onto the screen from the noise that they make. 

Controls:

Joy Stick/ D-pad - Move Ms.Pac-Man
Start Button - Pause Game
A or B Button - Pac-Booster

Hints:

Confuse 'Em
Whenever you find yourself cornered by ghosts, bottled into an area that you feel there is no escape from, don't give up hope immediately. While this does not always work, sometimes you can get the ghosts to change the direction they are moving in if you move back and forth or up and down really quickly. This seems to confuse them about where you are going and works better the further they are from you.

The story is about a pikeman named Imoto, who must descend to the abyss to save Shizuka, a maiden. After Imoto survives a battle in which all other combatants perish, he travels to Tengumura Village, where he collapses. The mayor, Akagi, greets Imoto and tells him that Shizuka needs to be rescued. Imoto heads into Tengumura Cavern.

Imoto, bearing 16 units of health (Qi, meaning "life energy"), dies when the health is depleted. He carries up to three lives. The game starts with three lives; once the life count is zero and Imoto dies, the game ends.

When Imoto defeats a boss, the words "monster defeated" appear and the player gains a scroll containing a new spell.

Musya uses Japanese kanji characters in various parts of the game to represent modes and levels. For instance, in the Japanese version of the game, the English-language word "Pause" is not used; instead the word Ippuku (meaning "break" or "to take a break") appears from both ends of the screen.

Mysterious Dungeon 2
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game , Fantasy
Release Year: 2006
Players: 1
Original Title: Fushigi no Dungeon 2: Fuurai no Shiren
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
Shiren is the simple story of a man following his friend's dying wish to find the Land of the Sun at the top of Table Mountain in feudal Japan. It's a rougelike - that is, the dungeon is randomly generated every time you visit it, and you start at level 1 with little or no equipment every time you play. The game has a few subplots you can advance by continually playing through, which is nice, and all of them will have some bonus to you as a player at their successful conclusion, be it a helper to follow you around or a new item becoming available in the dungeon.

Once you complete the main (Impasse Valley) dungeon, as well as a few of the subplots, you'll unlock a food-themed dungeon and a trap-themed dungeon for extra gameplay. Once these are completed and all of Fei's puzzles are finished, you'll unlock the ultimate challenge, a 100-floor dungeon (which, I might add, none of my testers were able to complete.)

Good luck, and remember, just because the random number generator hates you, it doesn't mean that the game's completely impossible!

Translation Description:

Here is what Gideon Zhi himself had to say about this patch:

"Shiren the Wanderer is the result of a number of years of work, and a number of hurdles that needed to be overcome. Among these are a nasty system of enscribable scrolls which needed to be reworked in English, a variable width AND height font, 24-24 text, and a slew of other, smaller issues. Suffice it to say that this release is quite pretty and, while not without a few minor flaws, is very much a playable and enjoyable game."

Mystic Ark, commonly (and improperly) known as "The 7th Saga 2 in some circles, is an RPG by Enix that spans worlds, and embeds a lot of adventure/puzzle elements into the genre. Disnesquick did the programming for our font, and the text was translated by Ian Kelley. You'll pardon the brief description, but it's after midnight, I've been working on this game virtually every available moment for the past two weeks, and I'm really, really tired. But the patch is out, so I guess it was worth it. I'm pleased with the result, but it took one hell of a lot of effort to get this far.

Contrary to my earlier beliefs, Mystic Ark is definitely not a true sequel to 7th Saga, although there are many similarities in the sylistics and characters. 7th Saga was a sprawling RPG directed toward vanquishing an ultimate foe, involving time travel. Mystic Ark appears to be a series of separate sketches that can be concluded in favor of several characters interacting with the main fighter, Remeer. Looks like a super fun game, as the dialogue I've seen so far promises a rollicking adventure.

As for this patch, it requires a headerless, de-interleaved ROM. CRC32 value FEB80589.

Due to incompatible coding with the real hardware (transferring to VRAM without waiting for vblank), this patch does not work correctly on most current versions of available SNES emulators other than ZSNES 1.51. This includes BSNES, SNES9x, and SNESGT. It has been reported to work on older versions such as SNES9x 1.4X and SNESGT .0218 that allow this incorrect behavior.

"Okay... So I was a bit harsh on it before, but..."

Intro
Originally, I gave this game a 1. Why, you ask? Most likely out of ignorance and impatience. I'm not above admitting I'm wrong (although someone did e-mail me about ''Escape from Camp Deadly'' and obviously didn't approve of the 3 I gave it. That's the score it has and that's the score it's going to bear under my name). After a long wait, I decided to play this game again. Once you have the timing down, it's a lot better.

NCW? Never Heard of 'Em. Eh...
In NCW, you play as a bunch of made up wrestlers with somewhat drab names like Asteroid and Hungry Snake (sounds like a Man Show reference). Anyway, you're competing to try to become Triple Crown Champion or something of that nature. The only way to do that is to defeat everyone else in the NCW.

Gameplay
The game is pretty basic with the attacks: regular punches and the like. Running off the rope and off the top rope, you can do other moves. While your opponents are down, you can also do various submission holds (although there is no submission in the game, or so it would seem as I've never made anyone give up). Yep, there's even grappling...

Grappling
You bump into you opponent grapple and you and your opponent lock arms. The thing is you have to be precise when you push the button combination for the move or your opponent will slam you instead. Timing is the key. It takes a bit of time before you can actually get the hang of it. It's pretty downhill from there. It mainly requires that you don't give up right away.

Options
There is the basic tournament as with many wrestling games. There is also the tag tournament, round robin, and exhibition mode. You can even play up to four players on this game.

Where it Lacks
Options. I felt this game could've used about one or two more types of options. While this can actually be a bit more fun and addictive than any of the mash-based wrestling games, it does sort of get old pretty fast. Thankfully, there's enough wrestlers to tide you over for a while.

...And Now, My Punishment...
BG: Well, as a guideline I have set up... If for any reason I have to change a review's over-all rating, I am to be punished severely for not seeing the light to begin with. Maynard, ready the Belt.

Maynard: Okay!

BG: For my punishment, I'm to take a belt to the bottom several times. WOOOPASH! Oh! WOOOPASH! You beast! WOOOPASH! The pain! The unbearable pain! WOOOPASH! That'll teach me to give good games bad scores! WOOOPASH! ...And no! I'm not changing my score on ''Camp Deadly!'' I thought that game sucked! WOOOPASH! ...Along with about 90% of the other Simpson's games! WOOOPASH! Simpson's Wrestling included! WOOOPASH! I think that's enough... WOOOPASH! Hey! Enough!

Maynard: Sorry... WOOOPASH!

Game Elements
The graphics were not bad, but not remarkable. To say they least, they were really basic on both color and detail. I thought the audience looked kind of lame, but the wrestlers and the ref don't look too bad. The sound was all together lame. I didn't like the music very much and would almost prefer Royal Rumble's sounds: fans cheering and two people going ''OOO! OOO! AH!'' The controls will take a bit of getting used to. It's mainly the timing thing. The gameplay is actually quite fun if you give this game a chance. Please, use my original review as a counter-example on two accounts: 1) How not to enjoy a game with an open-mind and 2) How not to make a fair and unbiased review.

FINAL JUDGMENT
Graphics: Workable 7/10
Sounds: Blech! 4/10
Controls: Just practice a little 7/10
Plot/Storyline: Not much of a real storyline, but this works good enough for a wrestling game 10/10
Gameplay: You'll have a bit more fun staring at a blank screen 7/10
All Together: 7/10

Recommendations
I'd say for fans of wrestling. In other words, no (or few, anyway) marks aloud. If you're only into the popular button-mashers, this game will be your torture device. If you're really not sure, give this game a little try.

"And the crowd goes silent!"

In its heyday, the SNES produced some namebrand basketball games that did right by the fans. NCAA Basketball captured the court's spirit of entertainment even with fictional players; NBA Live '97 harnessed excellent rosters from the post-'96 season when players like Marbury and Iverson were cutting their teeth in the big leagues. Heck, even NBA Jam's goofy portrait of showmanship was backed up with fun multiplayer. Enter: black sheep. Acclaim Japan continued a clumsy string of sports-related games with this embarrassing also-ran, despite a host of quality titles and ideas being demonstrated at the time.

And this ain't just an "oops, hehe" snafu -- this is a layercake of failure. Any league fan can quickly spot the derailment from the get-go. The gameplay options, which are basically made up of 'rounds of HORSE and free-throw shooting, are extremely boring -- not only because these are low-interest games played on a halfcourt; but because one normally associates the "NBA All-Star" namesake with fullcourt play and dunking contests, both of which are absent.

But even with pros playing these schoolyard games, the excitement is missing. An obvious reason is because few of the teams had immediately recognizable stars on their teams, and the player gets stuck with relatively obscure dudes like Roni Seikaly if they want to root for the home team. Each of the 27 teams is alloted one player, so it's slim pickins.

Barring player recognition, there's still the matter of gameplay. As previously stated, the all-star challenge is made up of short halfcourt games. On television, these are raucous showdowns where players go head to head with the crowd exploding at a fever pitch...this feeling does not translate at all. Instead, as a consolation prize, there is no sound whatsoever, except the dull thud of the dribbling and stock soundbytes of scuffling sneakers. All excitement has been ciphoned away, and the players (who look like pallette-swapped, skulking masses of bipedal play-doh) go about their business like they're playing in an empty gymnasium. They recreate the sound of no one caring about their product, which would be visionary if it wasn't so pathetic.

But the gameplay...for those that can stand boring peripheral details, the damning part lies here. Jumping takes place with one press of the action button, and shooting with the same button while in midair. This effectively throws player statistics out the window, as three-point sultan Larry Bird shows results little different than those of a pudgy center lobbing the ball with those same timed button presses. When the game shows promise but has horrible execution, y'gotta wonder what could have been with a bit more expansion shown and refined controls.

...No use weeping for what could have been. Repeatedly compounded shortcuts and failures only show the creators had no vision or love for the game, and wanted to ride the namebrand gravy train to make a buck...which is probably an accurate assessment of how much cash they actually hauled in. The only feature that keeps me blowing off the dust is that, when the game's paused, the referee says "Tiiiiiiimmmmmeeeee" in a way that sounds exactly like a sarcastic Phil Hartman.

Sadly, the box NBA All-Star Challenge shipped in is more fun to play with. Avoid at all costs.

Similar to Run and Gun, the in-game camera is at one end of the basketball court. Gameplay is fast-paced, much like NBA Jam and Konami's own Run and Gun. Elements lifted from arcade basketball games included limited fouls (that automatically lead to free throw shots), faster than real time clock, and basketballs rarely travel out of bounds. Free throw shots are simply a manner of trying to get two dots in the center as possible. The shot always goes in as long as both dots are blue; otherwise the shot always misses.

Gaming options include exhibition, regular season, playoffs, and arcade mode. Certain slam dunk and three-point field goal shots are replayed periodically. A play-by-play announcer comments on the in-game action. In addition to an arcade-style game, players can also customize in-game rules, or play a full-fledged simulation of professional basketball.

Players who wish to play in the playoff mode can choose either to re-enact the 1995 NBA Playoffs, have their playoff tree randomized by the computer or customize their own NBA playoff experience. Regular season games can also be customized while games in the "arcade mode" use the 1995 NBA Playoffs. Players can be substituted before a game but not during it. All NBA players are evaluated on a scale of 0 to 3 stars; 3 stars being the highest rating. Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan are missing from the game's rosters.

The gameplay is largely the same as the Midway's NBA Jam games, with some additions. One of the most prominent additions is the "Create Player" feature, which allows players to create a custom basketball player, specifying height, weight, power, shooting and defensive skills using a limited number of attribute points. Created players can be made more powerful as players earn additional attribute points by winning games.

The game retains many of the same rules of NBA Jam Tournament Edition, including the two-on-two match ups, statistics tracking, legal pushing and "on fire" mode. Additions to the gameplay include spin moves, alley oops and double slam dunks - a slam dunk performed after one team member in the middle of a dunk passes to the other member. Alley-oops and double dunks can trigger the new "team fire" mode in which both team members are on fire.

The player can select from any of the 29 NBA teams then in existence and match them in four quarters of NBA basketball (three minutes each), with three minute overtimes if necessary. Just as in the NBA Jam games, the game can keep track of the teams a player has beaten using a player's created ID and pin number. Optionally, the player can load their created player. Players using their ID face off against a series of NBA teams, starting with the Vancouver Grizzlies and ending with the Chicago Bulls (who were on their way to being NBA champions at the time of the game's release). After beating all 29 teams, the player faces of against a number of secret characters.

The game could be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two levels, "exhibition" or "playoffs". Players could pick from any of the NBA teams for the first time, including non-playoff teams. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters.

 - It was one of the first basketball games to feature every NBA team in the league. Tecmo NBA Basketball, which was released in 1991, was the first game to do so.
 - It was the first game to feature multiple generic custom teams like Skyers and Flyers.
 - It was the first basketball game to feature in-game 3rd party advertisements for companies like Starter and Topps stadium.
 - It was the first game to deviate from the traditional Eastern Conference finals team vs Western Conference finals team naming convention. Sequentially this title should have been called Bulls versus Suns following the 1993 Finals. There were controversies as to whether star players like Charles Barkley opting out of the players licensing had a profound effect on EA changing to a more generic name like NBA Showdown.
 - It was the first basketball game in which EA Sports, the entity, within EA officially took over the game.
 - The first EA sports game to have the tenths of a second rule in the last minute.

THE ORIGINS OF BASKETBALL

The year--1891, The place, --Springfield College, Springfield Massachusetts. Dr. james Naismith, rugby coach at the school, was given two assignments to complete. First, he was to find or invent a sport that athletes could play between football and baseball seasons. Second, he was to find a way to keep order in a class of competitive young men who were getting bored with the usual excerises and gymnastics.

He came up with the beginnings of a game that borrowed from rugby, soccer, water polo andother popular sports of the day. The school janitor was asked to find some boxes to be used as goals, but, unable to find suitably sized boxes, he suggested peach crates instead. Basketball's first game on record took place on December 21, 1891, between two teams of nine players each. As a former soccer player, he incorportaed rules and play techniques from that sport, and added a few new ideas. Hastily jotting down a dozen general rules, the first game of basketball was begun.

Minor competition started almost immediately, but basketball wasn't taken seriously as a sport until after the end of World War I. By this time the game had changed considerably since Dr. Naismith's original game. Dribbling had become the standard method of offense by 1896. Double dribble was outlawed in 1898, but dribblers were not allowed to shoot the ball until 1915. Backboards were added in 1895. In 1897 the number of players on a team was settled at five, after experiments with seven and nine players proved to be unworkable.

Onehundered years have passed, and basketball has changed from a diversion to entertain bored students, to one of the most popular sports in the world. Teams from all across the U.S. now compete in one of the most exciting meetings in sports today. From its beginnings as a student diversion, to today's March madness--basketball has come a long way.

"Gameplay should be much better"

It's too bad, this game seems to have some potential. So many flaws do this one in. It's a very nice looking game, all the selection screens have a backdrop of a still photo from an actual game. You pick your teams, and notice you have a choice of 40 different teams, with all their nicknames, logos, and a list of stats from the 1993 season. There is also an option of what weather in which to play, between fair, snow, or rain (although a better name for this option would be ''has rained''). The sound is very good as well. When you start the game, you'll hear a voice reminding you that you are playing ''NCAA Football''. That person also can say ''Touchdown'', ''It's Good'', ''No Good'', and ''Safety''. The player and crowd noises are nice as well, the crowd will cheer for the home team when it makes a good play, and get extremely pissed off if their team throws an interception or fumbles (even if they're up by 74 points with a minute left!). There is also music that plays while the score and stats are displayed. Not exactly what I'd call football music, but it sounds all right. When you get to the game, you'll notice 52 different offensive plays and 20 defensive plays, all very nicely diagrammed. Unfortunately, you have to play the game too.

Let's start by playing the computer. In a lot of games, the computer could be figured out in little time, and defeated every time you play it. This game is definitely one of them. In fact, this computer puts up less of a fight than any game I have ever played. Their quarterback is very, very easy to sack, and you hardly have to do anything to do so. If they do somehow complete the pass, or run the ball, they will do absolutely nothing to fool the defenders other than running in a straight line down the field. It's also very simple to score on offense. I'll just make a list of everything that's wrong with this game offensively.

TACKLING: Way, way, way too easy. If you dive after the player, you can bring him down by the shoestrings with one finger. Tackling without diving will also work most of the time, although occasionally the defender will either miss, or fall down. Don't think about breaking the tackle either, on 98% of all contacts, the player with the ball gets absolutely smothered. The remaining 2% includes fumbles, and missed tackles. So running the ball is not a very good option, since there's no reliable way of running past the defense.

RECEIVING: This is how it works: the receiver will go out for a pass, stand on the ''X'' until the ball gets there, and do one of two things. He'll either make the catch, or completely ignore the ball, turn around, and watch it hit the ground. There are no dropped passes. Still, it is very simple to complete passes. I just said the receiver will stand on that ''X'' and wait for the ball. Well, the defender(s) are very similar. Except they'll just stand about two feet behind the receiver until he catches it, and then make the play. So you can very easily just march down the field throwing the ball.

PENALTIES: The following penalties will be called: Offsides, Illegal Formation (kickoffs), and Delay Of Game. You see anything missing? Of course, no Pass Interference! You can do anything you want to stop the receivers from running their routes; often they are jammed at the line of scrimmage by the CPU players! And of course, the receivers aren't smart enough to simply run around them, yet the quarterbacks assume they will, and throw the ball to where the receivers should be! However, it's very difficult to stop them this way four consecutive times for a stop.

Taking those three factors into effect, the average player should defeat the computer by at least 50, on their first try!

One more thing I don't like about this game is the selection of teams. There's 40, and there were about 110 Div. 1-A teams at the time, so obviously some will be left out. But many powerhouse teams were left out. No Florida, Florida St., Alabama, Ohio St., Michigan, and Notre Dame, to name a few. But you can be Tulane, Hawaii, or Baylor!

Believe it or not, I do play this game often. But only against human players. Most games we play are very competitive, with scores most often in the 50-70's. But there is absolutely no reason to play against the computer, unless you just want to see how many points you can put up. I'll bet 1000 points could be scored against them in a 60 minute game with the right strategy. But that would take all day, and I don't have the time. Overall, unless the game costs less than 3 dollars, and you know people that are competitive at sports games and really want something new, do not buy this game; there are much better ones out there.

Neugier is wonderful little (if very short) game. It's one of those overhead action-RPG's (with a heavy emphasis on action) similar to Zelda (actually, I think it's closer to Lagoon, just a heck of a lot better, but then again Clu-Clu Land is a better game than Lagoon? ). The graphics aren't exactly anything to write home about, but that's okay because the fact that it is a completely fun game makes up for the graphics. The game follows the story of Duke, the banished son of the Count of Neugier who is returning home to investigate the sudden appearance of priates around his homeland. It's pretty good game, it should be worth your time

Newman-Haas IndyCar Racing featuring Nigel Mansell

Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell.

The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race. A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.

Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.

NFL Quarterback Club

NFL Quarterback Club is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System game series to feature quarterbacks from the NFL. Steve Young and Warren Moon are two examples of who players can use during the game. At the end of a regular game, the referee exclaims "That's the ball game," although this statement has never been used by real life NFL referees.

In 1994, NFL Quarterback Club was released for the Super Nintendo system. The main appeal about the game is that it offers three different types of modes to play in, making it more like three games instead of one. Up to four different players can play at the same time.

The first and perhaps most liked mode is the "QB Challenge". Players can choose from more than 12 of the NFL's premier quarterbacks to take part in a competition. There are four events in the competition. These are Accuracy, The Obstacle Course, Distance and Read And Recognition. Accuracy involves throwing the ball toward targets. The Obstacle Course is a track where the quarterback must jump over hurdles and go around defenders. Distance competition involves throwing the ball as far as possible, while Read And Recognition is the same as Accuracy but only certain targets hold point values. The QB with the highest number of points at the end of all four events is the winner. Each event can also be played individually if a player chooses to do so. Custom quarterbacks can be created to take part in the challenge. As the quarterback improves, his skill level increases.

The second mode is "Play NFL" and features playing a regular football game. Options include preseason, regular season play and direct playoff entry. All NFL teams are available. The player can import custom quarterbacks into a team. He also has the option of substituting quarterbacks from different teams into his. The play control is nice and crisp, and for the time it was released, the game had good graphics and sound effects. The only drawback in Play mode is lack of music and commentary during the game, except for the word "Touchdown!" when a player scores.

The third mode is "Simulation". There are 30 scenarios from previous games that a player must complete. Some scenarios have as little as 10 seconds left in the game, while others begin with over 15 minutes of playing time left.

The NHL series has introduced brand-new features for years. The Free-4-All mini-game was introduced in "NHL 2005," letting gamers compete with each other by scoring goals on one goaltender, either in a certain time limit, or until someone scores a certain number of goals. With appropriate settings, defensemen can be incorporated into the game, making it more challenging.

The NHL is not the only league in more recent games: A nordic expansion of NHL 2001 was published by EA Sports Nordica introducing Finland's SM-Liiga and Sweden's Elitserien. Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga was introduced in 2004 and the two previous leagues made a return. The game has expanded to include the Czech Republic's Tipsport Extraliga in "NHL 07." Before "NHL 07," users could only use European teams for Exhibition and Season modes. Now, users can bring a European team into Dynasty mode.

A revamped Create-a-Player feature is available after being taken out of "NHL 2005." Gone are the pre-modeled faces to choose from and in comes facial sculpting, inspired by that of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour videogames. Create-a-Team has remained the same. Players have the ability to recreate defunct or vintage teams, or start new ones with plenty of logos and jersey designs to choose from. The Hartford Whalers logo is not included due to the fact that the city of Hartford owns the team's rights and has prohibited the team's inclusion in the game. However, in "NHL 2001", there is a Hartford jersey selectable for Carolina in any modes. Create-a-Team is unavailable for the "NHL 07" Xbox 360 game. A Shootout mode is introduced in "NHL 07," mulating a true-to-NHL shootout. It is used to get Xbox 360 players familiarized with the game's new Skill Stick, as well as a means to practice shooting. Users have the ability to turn shootout rules on or off. Note: Shootout options in actual games will always be on.

The World Cup of Hockey was a feature in "NHL 2005", coinciding with said event featuring authentic rosters and uniforms. Infamously, it has been relabeled as EA Sports' World Tournament from "NHL 06" onward with fantasy jerseys, which were modified by substituting the team logos with flags and randomizing the jersey designs because of the lack of the IIHF license. Rosters in "NHL 06" were based on the Olympic rosters of the year.

NHL Stanley Cup lets all 26 teams from the National Hockey League at the time of the game's release (including the expansion Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim) compete for the highest honor in professional hockey, ]]. As it licenses from the NHL, but not the NHLPA, the game can use the team logos and the Stanley Cup but not the names of real players. Despite this, the players have strengths and weaknesses that correspond to their real-life counterparts, so e.g. Pittsburgh Penguins #66 or Los Angeles Kings #99 have an easier time scoring. You can substitute for or pull your goalie and institute line changes, but not line edits, as you see fit. Gameplay modes consist of Exhibition, Season and Best of Seven Series. Options include three different period lengths (5, 10 or 20 minutes) and having the penalties and line changes turned on or off.

This game mimics real ice hockey in that you can shoot, pass or dump the puck, and you can perform hip, shoulder and poke checks. You can even fake a slap shot and aim your shot on goal to a particular corner of the net. Hockey is an overtly brutal sport, and this game reflects that, but there are numerous penalties that you can commit, including tripping, cross checking, slashing, roughing, hooking, interference, icing and offsides.

A special Mode 7 viewpoint gives you a three-dimensional perspective that helps you keep your eyes focused on the puck, the center ice and the surrounding action. Battery backup lets you save your progress throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs. Other features include season and game statistics, three difficulty levels (Junior, NHL and NHL Pro), and the ability to skip games against particular opponents. After the end of each game, a sportscaster will give you a complete wrap up of the action.

It featured organ music and a digitized audience that cheered and jeered with every decision made on the ice. There is an exhibition mode and a playoff mode with the winner of the playoff mode collecting a trophy similar to the Stanley Cup. Offsides and penalties can be turned on and off but icing must remain on at all times. Notable contemporary players like Doug Gilmour and Wayne Gretzky can be seen as they attempt to score goals and steer clear from the penalty box. This game was released near the Christmas of 1992. Also, the game featured fighting, blood, and the ability for the glass of the arena to break. These features were removed in the following hockey games, except for fighting which was refeatured in NHL 96 and onwards.

The game had an NHLPA license but not an NHL license. As a result, the game included all player names and numbers, but not real team names or logos. Instead, teams were identified by their city and colors, which meant that the New York Islanders were referred to as "Long Island," even though the official name designated the team as such. Also introduced were Tampa Bay and Ottawa to the 22 teams of "NHL Hockey". The Sega Mega Drive version also included EEPROM battery saving, which allowed one to save lines and the ongoing Playoff, rather than use passwords.

The game also started a dispute between EA and the ruling bodies of ice-hockey. In the game, injured players often bleed, misaimed shots can break the glass behind the net, and the instruction manual makes references to injuring opposing key players, stating "Player injuries  it's a part of the game. Knock key opposing players out of the game with an extra hard body check."

A glitch in the game, which makes scoring extraordinarily easy, is found when one wraps around the right side of the near-side net. The goalie will never switch sides, allowing for a quick put in every time.

Three children or teenagers competed in four athletic events at the "Extreme Arena" for points. First place in each event was worth 300 points. Second place received 200 points, and third place earned 100. Each contestant was dressed in one of three colors: blue, red, and purple.

Some events were based on skills in popular sports, such as basketball, baseball, football and soccer. Others made use of a wave pool, and sometimes a racing track was used. During the show's run, more creative and ambitious events were invented, including a fabricated ski slope and the famous "Peak to Peak." Each event was said to allow the contestants to "live out some of their greatest sports fantasies" in a competitive arena.

After the first event, one of the three players was asked to "Spill Your GUTS" between the remaining events. In season one, Mike talked about the player and his or her athletic and non-athletic interests. In season two, Moira discussed the player's interests, and also mentioned what GUTS equaled to that player. In season three, during a brief prerecorded segment, players introduced themselves and revealed their athletic and non-athletic interests, what "having guts" meant to them, why they were excited to be on the show, and/or usually also give a shout-out to their friends and family back home. On Global GUTS, contestants introduced themselves; non-English speakers introduced themselves in their native language, and a translator did an English voice over for them.

Nigel Mansell's F-1 Challenge is a Super Famicom game that takes places in the Formula One circuit. The player can race a single race, do a season of Formula One, or practice their skills on a particular race track. Either music, sound effects, or both can be shut off on the options menu. The changing of the tires is mandatory on pit road during the middle of each race, and weather can determine whether the player should use hard tires, soft tires, or rain tires.

Being licensed by Mansell, the game followed the 1992 Formula One season, which he won. The player takes on Mansell's role to try and win the title again, against eleven other drivers. Like Sega's own Super Monaco GP, each of them belongs to their own team (instead of common F1 format of two drivers per constructor), however all are real-life drivers.

Nightmare Busters is a platformer that fell to the wastelands of unreleased snes games. Gameplay wise, it is similar in style to Super Mario Bros. Unlike many games that were abandoned, this game was eventually released in 2004 for cell phones as Flynn's Adventure. A prototype was found by DuoFan. The game was being created by Nichibutsu, who is more famous for their board and racing games for SFC than plaformers. The developer was apparently a company called Arcade Zone, who developed the game Legend. The game was shown at Shinshokai 1994, and made it into Nintendo Power's 1995 preview issue.

"Not too bad, Not too good"

This game was based on a movie that never did so well, so it seemed somewhat strange to come out with this game. I am kinda happy they did though. It is somewhat interesting, it takes strategy and thought. Most people never touched this game, and I can see why, no advertisement, and it was and is pretty hard to find. well with no further ado, heres my review.

Graphics: 5/10
Even for Super Nintendo these graphics are pretty bad. Sometimes it looks better than other times, and the drawings of the characters from the movies are good.

Sound: 6/10
Not good at all, but for the time, I can't complain so much. The grunts and such were depicted somewhat well, and explosions sounded decent. I mean don't expect a soundtrack like that of Breath of Fire 1/2 or Chrono Trigger, but don't expect to get overly annoyed with it either.

Controls: 5/10
Not really very reactant. Takes getting used to. For example, if you were to push the jump button it might take a second to jump. When you begin to get used to the controls, it stops being a problem. I also found during the trading sequences, there were ways to trade better items for worse, but I never figured out how to do this. The manual isn't very helpful in this matter.

Gameplay: 7.5/10
I guess this is probably where the game shines the most. The first few times you play, it is very interesting. You have to use your head in this game, and that can hurt. You need to use objects with other objects, to get past another area, or to make a even better object. My major complaint, is at a certain point, you are stuck with a battle, where you can not use weapons, and must fight a man while someone else drops things on you and spikes come up from the ground. this battle is impossible, and completely ruins the game. There is nowhere to go from here.

Replay Value: 8.5 in the beginning, later 3.5.
Like I said before, until you get to the impossible part of the game, it can be frustrating gameplay, but fun. I found myself playing it a good amount of times, but can't even touch it now.

Overall: 6/10
I think this is a game worth renting or trying out, but buying wise, you might want to leave it alone. It really isn't the worse game I have ever played, but it falls far short from being a good game.
Worth Renting, Not Worth Buying!

Nobunaga's Ambition
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge

Genre: Strategy , Turnbased
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Koei
Publisher: Koei
Players: 1
_________________________

Nobunaga's Ambition takes place during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. As the title suggests, the player is tasked with achieving the ultimate goal of warlord Oda Nobunaga; the conquest and unification of Japan. Selecting Oda Nobunaga is optional, however, as the player is also able to choose from a variety of other regional daimyos of the time.

Gameplay:

The player may choose from four campaign scenarios including: "Battle for the East" (beginning in 1560), "Daimyo Power Struggles" (1560), "Ambition Untamed" (1571) and "Road Towards Unification" (1582). In each scenario, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, provide a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty. Gameplay is taken in turns, with each turn in the map view corresponding to a season and each turn during battle corresponding to a day. The player may achieve victory through numerous means, among which are forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.

Nolan Ryan's Baseball
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Baseball
Release Year: 1992
Developer: Romstar
Publisher: Romstar
_________________________

"On the plus side, it came with a really cool poster"

Growing up, I was always a huge fan of Nolan Ryan. I'm not quite sure why. He never played on a team I followed, and he was near the end of his career by the time I got into Baseball. Yet, for some reason, there was always something about him that fascinated me. So much so that I spent an inordinate amount of money to get his rookie card recently. So much so, that one of the first Super Nintendo games I ever got, I bought for the sole reason that he was on it. Now, why is this important to you? Well, unless you happen to be a huge fan of Nolan Ryan and like to buy things just because his name is on it, this game might not be for you. It isn't all that bad though, it really can be a fun little game once you get into it. Plus, the game did come with a really nifty poster, so, that's something (although, odds are you probably won't get that with the game now. Nonetheless though).

As in many early Baseball games, there was no official licensing from Major League Baseball. So, aside from Nolan Ryan being on the cover, and the "T" team having a player on it named "Ryan," the rest of your roster will be filled with players with names like "Leo" and "Burt," and you'll be playing against teams like the "R" team and the "B" team. Everyone looks the same of course, so, your guess is as good as anyone else as to who these people, places and teams are. That's alright though, you're here to play Baseball, not look at names. It can get a bit confusing at times, but, it's not too big of a deal.

As far as the actual play of the game itself goes, it's fairly straightforward, no-frills Baseball. When you're on the mound, you pitch the ball, push down to make it go faster or up to make it go slower, left or right to make it go to the side. As your pitcher tires, the response of the ball will decrease. When hitting, you simply swing the bat or you don't. The annoying part to hitting is, if you stop midswing, instead of pulling the bat back, the hitter leaves it there, usually resulting in the ball hitting the bat and weakly rolling out to the mound. Aside from this though, pitching and hitting is about as one would imagine. Baserunning and fielding, however, are another story.

The game does have some issues here, in that things happen which shouldn't happen in a normal game of Baseball. Such as, the shortstop's throw taking two bounces on the way to first. Or, a runner moving from first to second on a hit to the outfield being thrown out before he reaches second. Or, the ever-frustrating first baseman who stands rooted to his bag as a ground ball rolls weekly a few inches away from him. So, yes, there are most certainly some little annoyances. For the most part though, it's not a normal game of Baseball.

That isn't to say there isn't anything that makes this game above average. For one, there's a season mode, which saves your record and statistics and whatnot. While it's true that, if you don't enjoy one game you're not going to enjoy a season's worth of them, it's a nice addition to be able to play through a season, working toward a goal, and accumulating stats. Whether you're just trying to get your team to have a good overall record, or trying to have a player excel in certain stats, or make an ace pitcher or whatever, the accumulation of stats can lead to a number of new goals within the game. In addition, there are a number of editing options within the game. While you can't just make a team of super-powered people, since there are rules on how exactly you can distribute stats, you're allowed to edit various statistics of the team's players, making a team that fits your liking. There's also a "Free Agent" pick, although what exactly differentiates one player from another isn't always particularly clear. 

These options are quite fun to play around with, and can add a good amount of replay value, as you play through the game with different types of teams.

As far as graphics and sound go, both of them are marked by a general feeling of mediocrity, with a few spurts of impressiveness. The graphics of the field, players on the field, and pretty much everything, for the most part, is nothing better than average. Where they stand out, however, is on highlights and close plays. Sometimes, as your fielder goes to dive for a ball, or there's a close play at a base, the game will zoom in to the play, showing the runner approaching the base as the ball approaches the glove, and you can watch as you see his foot hit the base a second before the pop of the ball into the glove. With music, likewise, the general background music is alright, but nothing special to speak of. However, the game includes voice for a number of things. You'll get to hear the umpire call out "Play Ball!" as well as the calls of strikes and balls, and safe and out at the bases. These touches, while not the most impressive things in the world, are still nice little additions.

So, in the end, what it comes down to is, this is a fairly average game gameplay wise, with some nice little bells and whistles tossed in. If you don't enjoy the simplistic gameplay, you're not going to care in the least about the closeups on plays, or the customization or anything. While the gameplay doesn't really stand out in any respect, in most cases it's not going to cause any major problems where it's going to cause you to be turned off. If you like Baseball games, this does a decent enough job of the basics. Once you get past this, the game does have a number of nice little options to it. The customization options are very good, and can give you some new and interesting ways to play the game. As well, the season play is definitely a very welcome addition, as playing through a season and building stats is very enjoyable, spread out over a few days, a few weeks, or a few months. 

It's easy enough to just sit down for a few minutes to play through a game or two, and end up going through much more than that. While there may be better options out there for your SNES Baseball fix (in particular, the Ken Griffey games and Baseball Simulator 1.000, among others), Nolan Ryan's Baseball can still be a nice little addition to your collection. Especially if you're a Nolan Ryan fan.

Kyle's Quest

As the passing day resides into night a cold and dark presence overwhelms the land. Looming in the midnight, shadowing the dead ground below, is the accursed castle of Nosferatu. Ancient in history, deadly in the present, this remnant of times past has griped the land with death and terror.

Nosferatu, creature of night, a name feared by all. His reign of terror stretches across the land with unspeakable horrors. Those few who have seen him dare not speak his name. Those unfortunate to meet him have never been seen again.

Only one races to end the terror. Only one with the courage of many takes to arms to rid the land of Nosferatu. Kyle, driven by his quest, races to save his fair maiden taken by Nosferatu. Time is a factor as he draws closer to the castle. Many obstacles lay ahead, but Kyle has no remorse for those in his path.

An army of darkness awaits. Kyle's Quest will be long and hard.

Dragoner/Dragon Master Fix

This patch moves Dragoners and Dragon Masters from the Fighter class tree to the Amazon class tree. Using a DRAGOS on a Beast Master will still change him into a Dragoner. Both classes also have different alignment, charisma, and minimum level requirements reflecting their status as sister classes to the Beast Man/Beast Master classes.

STORY OF OGRE BATTLE

The days of Zenobia are growing dark and cold -- evil is running rampant over the entire continent. Shadows of men roam the streets, whispering of the demise of their great King. The trusted Sage Rashidi fell prey to the evils of power, and in its grip, Rashidi slew Gran, the mighty King. Rashidi then joined forces with Empress Endora, and their reign of terror spread to the entire continent. Thus the Zetegenian Empire was born.

YOUR MISSION

It's been nearly a quarter of a century since the reign of terror began. The Empire rules with neither justice nor compassion. The last remaining members of the rebellion are gathering on the outskirts of Sharom. The rebellion is greatly outnumbered by the mighty Empire, and there seems no way to defeat such an evil power. However, secrets carried through the wind tell of a great Wizard, "Warren" who may be willing to help you. Choose your path wisely, listen carefully to the people, and gain their confidence. If you are not careful, all will have been in vain. You will have toppled an evil Empire, only to start one of your own.

--From the SNES Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen instruction manual.

Overview:

Raise an army powerful enough to stop the Black Queen!

Ogre Battle is, in my opinion, one of the best strategy games released for the SNES. Enix, the same company that brought us the classic Dragon Warrior series, produced it, so its quality can hardly be questioned. This game was very complex, but unlike many other strategy games, the complexity of Ogre Battle is one of its best features. The level of detail makes the game more realistic and enjoyable. Many war games overwhelm the player with tedious details that slow the game and make the experience more excruciating rather than more interesting. Enix managed to avoid this pitfall and produce one truly classic strategy game.

Directions:

The game could probably be called an RPG as well as a strategy game. When you start a new game, you create a character by answering a series of questions for the wise man Warren. Depending on your answers you are given a selection of Tarot cards that you will use later in the game.

You start off with a small band of warriors and have to fight on a "proving ground" to show you have what it takes to command an army.

As you move your forces to capture cites and other locations, you will find more Tarot cards and even special items. The Tarot cards have special effects during battles and should only be used at need. You can only keep a limited number, however, so throwing one down once in a while is a good idea. The items you find can be equipped to certain members of your army depending on the item in question and the class of the unit you want to give it to. These items greatly increase that unit's strength and should be utilized as much as possible.

I mention your unit's class because each unit does have a class. In fact, each unit is considered an individual and has not only a class, but also hit points and even stats, along with attacks based on their class. They gain experience in battle and can upgrade to different classes as they gain levels. The units even have an alignment that makes a difference when they fight. Alignment comes into play because the game takes place in real time and has both a day and night cycle. Depending on the party's alignment they may fight better during the day or night. Their attacks are also stronger on the type of terrain they are best suited to. For instance, giant octopus fight best in the water. These subtleties give the game a definite RPG feel.

Even economy is included in the dazzling number of features Ogre Battle has to offer. Again, Enix didn't overload the gamer with details, but added a system that was simple to use and gave the game even more depth. Each day that passes, you collect revenue from towns you currently have control of. You use the money you collect to deploy your units, recruit new units and even buy items at certain towns. It's a simple system, but can make a huge impact on the way you play the game.

The game is actually its own tutorial, so you need almost no instruction to get started. Each town you capture gives you advice on game play and information you will use throughout the game. This makes the game easy to get started on, even though there are an almost dizzying number of options. I have only touched the surface of the game in reality. Ogre Battle is a game that can hardly be explained: it must be experienced, and I suggest you do so. 

Hints:

As in any RPG style game clerics are the bane of undead. If you forget this you will regret it.

As in the previous titles, there are three difficulty levels and both Olympics and mini-olympics (here called custom game) modes; however, the points table was removed, and the only way to compare results is by the medals' table. In the sprinting events, there are two qualifying rounds, and only the winner (out of only four competitors) pass to the next round. On long jump, triple jump, discus and javelin each player has three attempts; the best 10 progress to the final and have three extra attempts. The best result overall wins. In high jump and pole vault there aren't qualifying rounds, the players jump in turns until missing three consecutive jumps.

The difficulty levels are terribly uneven. While in the high jump they can break the olympic record in easy and miss the 5.80 m barrier at hard, in skeet at easy, top computer players hit 3, in normal 4 and in hard 5. This also leads at an incredibly long medal-awarding ceremony, with four or five competitors in the bronze or silver medal. It's impossible to break the records on archery and skeet events, as the best possible result in skeet is 25 (5x5, the equivalent of only one perfect day) while the record is set on 200 points, and archery with a possible result of 180 (6 arrows in 3 rounds) and 338 points as the record. The remaining records are perfectly possible to be beaten by expert players. The lack of EEPROM saving (which was already common in 1996) means the records are not logged inside the game, and as soon as the console is unplugged (rather than just reset), the default records return.

Operation Europe: Path to Victory is a multiplatform war game where one or two players can compete in World War II action. The object of the game is to fulfill any one of the military objectives for either the Axis or the Allied forces. Players engage in modern warfare around Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and North Africa.

This game uses abstract numbers and figures in the map view and saves the concrete illustrations of soldiers only when they lock horns on the battlefield or in an urban setting. Urban settings give a traditional 1930s view of housing and office buildings that provide extra protection for units that are guarding them. However, there are massive numbers to crunch and the lack of graphics help enhance the number crunching ability of game's artificial intelligence.

This game is the sequel to Operation Wolf. Roy Adams and Hardy Jones, two green berets, must save American hostages from a hijacked airliner which was forced to land in the fictional African province, Kalubya. To do this, they must capture six different bases, shoot enemies such as soldiers, jeeps, tanks, and helicopters using your machine gun or grenade launcher, and try to save the hostages along the way. The enemies fire at you with bullets, grenades, or rockets, which must try to avoid. Once capturing the bases and achieving all objectives, the game will restart from the beginning and the difficulty will increase.

The Super NES version also works with the SNES Mouse and the Super Scope. In addition, the player was able to choose from a variety of different characters. The storyline was altered in that the hijackers were members of a fictional country known as the Bintazi People's Republic, ruled by General Abul Bazarre, ruler for life. General Bazarre demands that his comrades be freed or else the hostages will be executed.

At first, when seeing a game named Oscar within the annals of GameFAQs, I had a severe underlying fear: that it would be a game based on the movie starring Sylvester Stallone. I've never seen that movie in my life, but fortunately, it was not that, and my fears were clearly not founded in reason. I did have something else to be afraid of, however: it is made by Titus - yes, the very same Titus whose employees are still being pelted with rotten eggs for the crime that is Superman 64. Therefore, it was with much trepidation that I approached Oscar. It will pleasantly surprise many Titus haters to know that I in fact was pleasantly surprised by this game. It goes almost strictly by the book, which is apparently what Titus needs to do to make decent games. Come with me, if you will, as we explore Oscar.

I don't know what the main character is supposed to look like, or even what his name is. He does, however, start out in a movie theater, and can venture into one of four movies being screened - a prehistorically set movie, a horror flick, a cartoon, or a Western. He doesn't watch the movie though, he goes into that movie, and must locate several Oscars (hence the title of the game) to escape the movie. Each movie consists of three scenes, and you must find a set amount of Oscars that look strangely like our white-haired protagonist and then a clapboard, which serves as the exit, to finish the level. The hero - I'll just call him Oscar to keep it easy to follow - starts out with jumping on enemies as his only line of defense. If he finds the right icon, he'll have a yo-yo so he can strike foes from a distance (this yo-yo makes the game so much easier).

There are also bonus levels where you collect scads of items for points and extra lives played after each level. To access those, you'll have to hunt for the letters that spell BONUS before you locate the clapboard. Most of the points you earn come from finding artifacts related to the movie you're in. In the prehistoric setting, for example, you'll find primitive weapons, bones, and saber-toothed tiger teeth just floating around, and in the Western you'll find looted money lying about all over the place. Several other items can either help or hinder you as well, like the elixir which makes Oscar invisible for a while; or they may have comical effects that you weren't anticipating. One of these comical items that I nearly died laughing over was the Game Boy. Grab one, and all of the scenery turns that monochromatic green tint we all know and love. Lightening the mood like that certainly helps this platformer achieve more than just bargain bin status.

Oscar's control is a bit more laid back than I would like. Go into the prehistoric movie first - it'll give you time to get acquainted with his footloose moves and all the other ways he operates. L and R make you face left and right respectively, B jumps, and Y uses the yo-yo if you have it. Of course, the D-pad moves you around. Oscar runs everywhere he goes. This means that you're not exactly going to be making a lot of three-point landings to start out. Controlling Oscar correctly takes time and patience. Once you have the hang of him, jumping on enemies will be just as simple as swinging the yo-yo around. He moves a bit fast for my taste, but then, Sonic the Hedgehog runs everywhere he goes, so I guess Oscar doesn't have too much of a problem.

The graphics aren't anything to write back home about, but are sufficient for this offering. Oscar was released in 1996, about the time the SNES took a dive here in the States, but it looks like something that could have just as easily been put together in 1992. The zoom-in stuff at the title screen just doesn't cut it as far as cutting edge goes, but the fading to scenes is done nicely. I like the way things are executed, and even though there is a specific level for cartoons, the whole game appears to be one. I like many of the sprites, except for Oscar himself. Oscar is ugly - what is he? A badger? A monkey? What? A little more detail could have gone into everything as a whole, as well. By the way, I'm still laughing at the Game Boy thing.

It's the sound and music that are truly annoying in this game. All the music has a way too .... I don't know .... MIDI feel to it. It's nothing special, not exactly Nobuo Uematsu-caliber music, if you catch my obscure reference. Sad to say, the music does annoy me, and the sound effects aren't much better. Every time Oscar nabs another Oscar, he says, ''Thanks, everybody!'' This reaches its optimum level of annoyance when there are several Oscars grouped together in a small area. Almost every sound effect seems as though someone has just crashed head-on into some kind of metal, be it sheet metal, steel, what have you. I don't blame you if you choose to mute the sound and then plug in some of your own music. Personally, I can really get into Oscar when I'm listening to Nickelback.

A person could easily look at a game like Oscar and think, possibly aloud, ''Pfft, it's no wonder the Super Nintendo isn't around anymore, thanks to giraffe excrement like this.'' True, it is one last weak gasp of air for the SNES, and could even be looked at as an attempt to create a Mascot Who Becomes Popular And Stars In Many Sequels And A Bad Movie Of His Own. Some will even cackle with irony as they ponder how this game is eighty thousand times better than Superman 64 or practically anything else Titus has made. This game is worth a rental if you can muster the guts to give it a whirl. It has somewhat of a learning curve - a peculiar thing to say about a platformer, but Oscar does take time to become accustomed to. I commend Titus for finally doing one by the numbers, because they actually cranked out something I can entertain myself for at least an hour with.

And the Oscar Goes To...
--Hilarious items
--A decent challenge for a while
--Sufficient graphics, although dated

It Was An Honor Just To Be Nominated
--Rinky-dink music and sound
--Control takes some getting used to
--If you can't forgive Titus for Superman 64, you won't like this

Story of Lester Knight Chaykin

The laboratory was engulfed in a sea of storm. This in no way disheartened young nuclear scientist Lester Knight Chaykin as he raced towards the lab in his Ferrari. It would take more than a storm to keep him from trying his new experiment. In his excitement, he barely noticed the dark clouds looming on the horizon. Even if he had, there was no way for Lester to even imagine the events that were about to take place.

The violence of the brewing storm was soon forgotten once Lester stepped into the quiet of the elevator. His slow descent into the lab only seemed to create more excitement Lester could almost feel electricity in the air. Spending some time away from his lab had helped him to understand his earlier errors. With this new understanding, Lester was sure that his new particle acceleration experiments would be perfect.

Before he could gain entrance to the lab, Lester had to wait impatiently for the security scan. Lester was ready to begin his experiment and didn't have time for what he thought were unnecessary security measures. Through the security door Lester stepped into the mess he called his office. The piles of notes, empty soft drink cans and pizza boxes were a testimonial to the long hours of work that had passed before. Lester flipped a switch and with a beep his computer snapped to life. He quickly entered his password and began to enter the parameters for his new experiment.

Now, he had only to wait. As he had done a hundred times before, Lester kicked back with a cold soda while the computer chugged away with the test. Any minute the computer would give him the results and he would know if he had indeed made a breakthrough. But outside, the storm had other plans for tonight. As Lester sat watching his experiment run to perfection, the storm unleashed a tremendous bolt of lightning. The wave of electricity cut through the cool night air like a knife and hit the laboratory with deadly accuracy. Lester was unaware of what was happening outside. Just as the computer activated the accelerator the bolt of lightning found its way into the system with almost willful precision. As Lester sat with his icy cold soft drink, what was certain to be his demise was racing towards him through the accelerator at the speed of light. 

The bolt hit the end of the accelerator and exploded through the wall unleashing the fury that only a bolt of lightning is capable of. It coiled around Lester like a python until a massive charge was built up. Detonating in a brilliant flash of light, only an empty space was left where Lester used to be....

Pierre le Chef is touring the world preparing his dishes, but his ingredients have escaped and he must capture them. Pierre must watch out for bacteria, insects, and his arch-rival, Le Chef Noir. Noir, an evil chef jealous of Pierre's success, wants to ruin his career by releasing all of his gathered ingredients.

Gameplay:

The objective is to capture a set number of ingredients before the time runs out. In later levels more ingredients need to be captured and more enemies appear. Ingredients must be caught in the net and emptied into the level's cage. Stunning the ingredients by jumping on them or hitting them with your weapon makes it easier to catch them because, when they are stunned, they stay still. Any number of ingredients can be captured before dropping them into the cage. Each captured ingredient drops into the cage individually over a short period of time while Pierre stands on it. After the required number of ingredients is in the cage a warp door will appear that will lead Pierre to the next level.

Between certain stages, if the right goals are met, there will be bonus a stage where Pierre tries to collect as many bonus items as he can before time runs out. There are also secret rooms in certain stages, which are revealed by completing the requirement to unlock the room. The secret rooms contain bonus items that increase your score and sometimes contain an extra life.

After Pierre runs out of lives or the game is beaten, the score is entered into the high score table and a title is awarded.

Outlander is an action driving video game with a post-apocalyptic theme. It was rumoured that it was to be titled Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, following suit from Mindscape's previous Nintendo NES Mad Max title based on the same movie, however Warner Brothers did not give Mindscape the required rights. Mindscape edited the graphics and changed the name from Mad Max II into Outlander. Along with the similarities to the Mad Max universe including their own version of the V8 Interceptor, there is a tribute on the life bar meter on the bottom of the screen. It says "MAX" but it was placed there to serve more as a homage as opposed to letting the player know they had maximum health. The game has achieved Cult status among Mad Max fans and Retro Gamer fans alike. The game was developed and published by Mindscape in 1992 for the Sega Genesis and in 1993 for the Super Nintendo.

"P.T.O II Is Also Shorthand For "Play This One, Too!""

As another reviewer put it, PTO II is like foreign cheese: not everyone is going to like it, and it does take some getting used to. I tend to agree. He also states that this game is not for those who do not like strategy games. I also tend to agree. PTO II is a very demanding strategy game set in WWII that emphasizes micro-management. If you thought Liberty or Death was confusing, try this! PTO II, while being quite confusing, is also a lot of fun once you know how to play. And with greatly improved graphics and sound this time around, this game blows it predecessor out of the water! Now, the review...

Graphics - 8/10
HUGE improvement over PTO I. PTO I's visuals were, in a word, awful. They reminded too much of the lackluster Uncharted Waters (NOT New Horizons, its sequel, which was much better). Now, these visuals are more gritty. The portraits of your officers are much better-looking, as are the ships, planes, and other military crafts. The map is accurate and colourful, so identifying ports and ships is a breeze. The battle scenes are excellent (especially the plane attacks). Overall, KOEI did a much better job here.

Sound - 7/10
KOEI was never big on music. There are a few pieces here and there, but they are short. But, they are also much better than PTO I's music. I especially loved the Americans mission music and the title screen. The sound effects, on the contrary, are well-done, complete with guns a-blazing and bombs exploding. What KOEI lacks in music in PTO II, they made up for it with sounds. Another good job done here.

Gameplay - 8/10
This department can either be the grace of this game or its downfall. It all depends on how much the player loves slow-paced, demanding strategy, as well as patience. For me however, I love the gameplay. You can play as the US or Japan, and even both! Playing against yourself has never been this fun! Also, you don't have to worry about your land troops anymore (thank goodness!), just the Navy. The monthly conference, with its card system, was quite clever, I might add. A bit frustrating for new players, but fun once you get the hang of it. But, I did dock a few points for seemingly endless amount of menus. KOEI loves menu-based strategy, but they didn't know when to draw the line here!

If you're looking for some fun, albeit frustrating and confusing, strategy games, PTO II should be one of your top choices. It's sleek, it's slick, it's fun, and set in the second World War. What more could you want? Fewer menus, perhaps? That wouldn't have been a bad idea, but nonetheless, this game is enjoyable. Go play it now.

Pac-Attack is a puzzle game somewhat similar to Tetris. Basically Pac-Man is ghost hunting once again, not gobbling pellets this time but concentrating on wiping out his enemies. Your job is to set up the bricks so that they make complete lines which are eliminated, and also set up the ghosts so that when Pac-Man drops in he eats as many as possible.

Pac-Attack has really good graphics for a simple puzzle game. I guess the only disappointment is that all the ghosts are the same. But then, if they were supposed to be the original Pac-Man ghosts, I guess you could only have four at a time.

Directions:

Rotate the pieces as they fall, to set them up the way you want. Each piece contains three squares, which can be a brick, a ghost or a Pac-Man. The pieces aren't solid, meaning that everything falls to the lowest point possible. The bricks can be eliminated by forming a solid line just like in Tetris. The ghosts all turn blue when Pac-Man drops in, so he can eat them. Pac-Man will follow the path of least resistance down the screen, so the trick is to put the ghosts where he will be able to get them all before he hits bottom.

The evil Ghost Witch has cast a vicious spell on Pac-Man and thrown him back in time to when he was a Pac-Boy. Only you can save him now. Down some Pac-Pellets and get ready to battle your way through a totally supersonic side-scrolling adventure. Journey through snowy mountains and forests, collect fireballs and bubbles, crush Pac-Bats and ghosts, swim like a fish and swing like a monkey...and ultimately get Pac-Man back to the real world!

--From the SNES Pac-In-Time instruction manual.

Overview:

Pac-In-Time is a bit of an unusual platformer, and definitely a change of pace from most Pac-Man games. Defeat the Ghost Witch and her minions to help return Pac-Man to his proper time and place.

Pac-In-Time was a pretty good-looking game for the SNES system. Nice and cartoonish, good backgrounds and sprites, decent animation. The sounds seemed a bit behind the times, but not bad enough to detract from playing the game.

Welcome to Pac-World!

You are about to enter a cartoon universe that is home to the greatest video-game hero ever: Pac-Man! In Pac-World, Pac-Man is free to explore every nook and cranny of a wild and wacky cartoon land. Along the way, he goes on some way-out adventures (and even runs into a little trouble). The world's first interactive cartoon concludes with a battle against the Ghost Witch of Netor to return all the stolen bubble gum to the kids of Pac-City!

--From the SNES Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures instruction manual.

Overview:

Another update of the popular Pac-Man series. This new version is more of an interactive cartoon than a video game. Pac-Man and his family have normal problems like any family might have, like needing milk for the baby. These little problems are Pac-Man's "missions" which you must help him solve. Unfortunately you don't control Pac-Man directly, but you guide him by trying to call his attention to certain things, manipulating obstacles in his path, and shooting him a Power Pellet when he needs a Super Pac-Man boost.

Beware, in addition completing to Pac-Man's tasks, you also have to watch out for the good ol' ghosts. They'll come looking for you and try to ruin Pac-Man's life and hurt the ones he loves. But don't relax just because you don't see any bad guys, there are lots of other ways for Pac-Man to hurt himself if you let him.

Developer: Asmik Ace Entertainment
Publisher: Enix

The game centers around a boy named Chezni who, on a dare, activates an ancient machine called Dal Gren and in doing so releases a being of immense power and evil. As a result the magic school is destroyed and the headmaster of the school orders Chezni to destroy Dal Gren at whatever cost before it destroys the world. During his travels he meets a girl named Midia, very much like himself, who wishes to help him on his quest, and numerous other mercenaries that come to aid Chezni. The main antagonist is a young dictator named Zaygos, who wants to use the Dal Gren for his own nefarious purposes.

Paladin's Quest draws gameplay features from many other games of its era, and adds some interesting innovations of its own to the mix. Like many RPGs, the game has a battle mode and an adventure mode - within the adventure mode, the character might be in the overworld map or a dungeon (in which case the player will meet with random encounters), or in a town (in which case random encounters do not occur). This mode is a traditional top-down view. In case of a battle, the game switches to a battle mode. In battle, the player is "facing" the enemy, similar to the Dragon Warrior games. The game's battle mode is Turn-based, in contrast to the Active Time Battle system used by the Final Fantasy games in the same time period. That is, increasing a character's speed increases the chances of acting earlier within a turn, but does not change how frequently that character's turns come about. From each battle, characters accrue experience points, which eventually lead to higher levels, and better attributes. 

During battle, use of healing items usually, but not always, takes priority and occurs before the enemy can strike.

One of the unique things about the gameplay in Paladin's Quest is the magic system. It has several unique features:

 - There is no form of MP for the characters. Instead, characters cast spells by spending their own HP. Only one spell exists in the game to directly heal HP, and using it kills the caster in order to heal the rest of the party. A character early in the game pokes fun at this, saying, "MP? Where did you hear such superstitious nonsense?"

 - Instead of characters learning spells individually, characters gain "spirits", of which there are eight total - Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Sphere, Sky, Heart, Light. Spells are the result of two spirits combined, and each spirit has one spell unique to that spirit. So, a user who knows the "Fire", "Sphere", and "Light" spirits would know six spells - one each unique to "Fire", "Sphere", and "Light", and three combination spells - "Fire-Light", "Fire-Sphere", and "Sphere-Light". Every spell has a unique name and effect.

 - There is no statistic which universally enhances a character's spellcasting ability. Instead, characters gain experience in each spirit as they cast related spells - a combination spell's power is based on both spirits it uses. To gain experience in a spirit, the character simply uses a spell involving that spirit.

The healing system in Paladin's Quest is also unique - items cannot be used from battle unless they are equipped, traditional healing spells are nonexistent, and extra healing items cannot be purchased. The primary healing items in the game are healing "bottles", which are good for nine uses each. These bottles cannot be purchased, and must be found while adventuring, although they can be refilled cheaply at most towns. The only other healing items are certain pieces of equipment which can be used as an unlimited healing item, but can only heal the wearer, and cannot be used outside of battle mode. In many other RPGs it is possible to buy many cheap healing potions, and use them to heal after random encounters throughout a dungeon, and immediately before a boss battle - such an option is not available in Paladin's Quest, and finding ways to maintain adequate HP and healing bottles throughout a quest is an important part of a successful strategy to beating the game.

Finally, the party system is different from other RPGs. The player controls a party of up to four characters - up to two main characters, while the rest of the party slots can be filled by mercenaries. Although the player controls a mercenary's actions in battle, the player does not have any control over the equipment they wear, and cannot purchase spirits for them. Many mercenaries have certain strengths and weaknesses (for example, many have spirits not yet available to the player, and so have spells not yet available to the player's main characters). Some mercenaries also lack a healing bottle, making them unable to do any healing in a battle. New, stronger mercenaries are available often as the player progresses through the story (usually for a price), but it is up to the player whether to continue by leveling their old mercenaries, or hiring new ones. All mercenaries may be rehired, with the exception of a single mercenary tied to a story event.

Tips:

Debug Menu
At the start of the game, when asked to enter the hero's name, use any name starting with a lowercase 'e'. This causes the debug menu to become available.  (This can delete saved games)

How to explain this game ? hmm ? AH!

Panic in Nakayoshi World is a lot like The Adventures of Lolo (for Nes). You walk around in a single-screen room that has an overhead-view. Kinda like Lolo. However, there's no real puzzles involved, and you don't have a limited number of shots with which to kill stuff, so that little "which enemy do I kill?" strategy element is kind of ? non-existant. Unfortunately, those elements are what made Adventures of Lolo a great game, and the lack thereof is what makes this game crappy. Oh yeah, and Sailormoon is in it too. So I suppose that makes it that much worse. So? maybe it's not a lot like Lolo.

What the game boils down to is this: you're one of four characters from various animes. You have to save the world. Saving the world involves going through various rooms. To advance to the next room, you have to kill enough monsters (may not make sense in real life, but this makes perfect sense in the world of video game logic). After six levels of this, you fight a boss. Then, the scenery changes, I suppose to "break the monotony". The game probably ends eventually, with a silly anime cut scene where Sailormoon probably steals the show from the worthwhile characters. For me, it ended an hour after I started playing it, right after I exited out of ZSNES.

Anyway, if this type of game is your cup of tea, try it out.

This hack is worth playing simply due to its originality! Be warned however that some may find its content offensive. If you are not easily offended, it is hilarious with its use of violent imagery, such as the numerous squirming, bleeding Toads impaled on stakes in a graveyard as shown in the screenshots, not to mention that Morton's Jail has to be the single most disturbing level ever created for a Mario game! There are also many drug references, a hidden evil Kirby world, and if you can find it, an Adults Only Palace of Hentai. This hack is very fun and is about the same level of difficulty as the original. It features awesome graphics rips, music and overall feel from Super Mario Bros 3, custom blocks, overworld and sprites. Even the credits have something interesting and unexpected in them! So, if you don't have a problem with some morbid humor and twisted creativity, this is the game for you. Enjoy.

It's early morning and the birds are singing. That familiar "TWAP!" could only mean one thing--look out, the Paperboy is back! Paperboy 2 is a daredevil stunt rider with a new look - he's a boy or she's a girl! The neighborhood has changed too! There are more types of houses, including mansions, haunted houses, and kids' club houses. There are also more obstacles, such as gargoyles, ghosts, and sewer monsters. Luckily, Paperboy 2 has improved steering ability and can deliver to both sides of the street. Nonetheless, Paperboy 2 still needs help (and skill) to survive the hazards of the suburban jungle!

Awesome awesome game. Apparently it's based on some kind of manga that was really hot in Japan at the time. You know Enix, they love them manga-to-game adaptations. And they don't suck like Banpresto's! Hahaha! Ow! OW! Hey stop that!

So anyways Papuwa's this guy, you know? And the game he's in is this side-scroller. And you run around hitting things. I'm not sure why, cause the intro's not translated. Dof! But hey! There are karakasas in the game! Of Azumanga Daioh fame. As soon as I saw it, I thought "Hey, I remember Osaka in an outfit that looked just like that." And that's my karakasa story.

Translation Description:

THIS GAME RULES. Play it. Okay, now the important stuff. Lots of stuff has been done, and lots of stuff hasn't, such as the opening and any graphical text. And the credits, but I'll be damned if I can get that far. I suck at this game. Anyway, hopefully F.H. can tidy up the rest of it, because, well, the game rules. Thanks to Karin Aoi, Unicorn23/Rom, David Mullen, Dark Force, and F.H. for a translation I've been eagerly expecting for a long long time. Hurray!

Gameplay:

The player's ship can switch to different speeds at any time, allowing the player to move fast to avoid enemies and obstacles entirely, or slow down to weave between enemy bullets. An unusual addition for a shooter at the time is the ability for the player's ship to take multiple hits before losing a life. A variety of weapons can be picked up from items that certain enemies leave behind, and up to three can be stored at a time. The player can switch between these weapons freely, and sacrifice a weapon to produce a "smart bomb" effect, freeing up the slot to grab another weapon.

Trivia:

Phalanx is infamous for the incongruous box art in its American release: it displays a bearded elderly man dressed in overalls, wearing a fedora and playing a banjo while a futuristic spaceship flies in the background. The popular media site IGN named it their 5th "Most Awesome Cover" in a recent Top 25 Countdown on their website.

The box art designers later admitted that they had deliberately chosen this theme in order to attract the customer with something original considering there were many space shooters in the market that looked alike. The Game Boy Advance release redesigned the cover in favor of a prominent spaceship image.

Tips:

Secret Area
On Level 2 the Underwater Area, when you see a red box on either the top or bottom screen, enter it and you will go into a secret area. Their are two secret Areas in the Underwater Area. The first one's on the top. And the second one's on the bottom.

1st- When you have to move and either destroy or dodge the poles that come at you, at the last one, where it stays and you have to be careful not to get hurt because it's a thick area and you have to move slowly, go up to the top and quickly into the red box .

2nd- After you go pass the revolving circle of bones that don't connect together, go through it. To know which one it is, its the one where inside the circle of bones have a P power up there. After that, look towards the bottom of the screen and look out for it.

Secret Area 2

In the last stage- Final Mission, there are 2 secret areas in this place. The secret place looks like a yellow circle with some gadgets around it.

1st: When you have to slowly go through a series of bars, make sure you just don't take damage or if you do, just quickly cross it to the top to the Yellow circle .

2nd: Can't exactly remember but its after the sub-boss you have to fight. The sub-boss is this weird looking ship where it spits a gravity whole in nowhere between the middle of the screen and then his two projectile users try to slam into you. I just know this one's on the bottom and its right before you go to these weird monsters where they look like cubes and some disgusting cube worms that drip acid water, which damages you so just dodge it.

The game follows primarily side-scrolling action elements not unlike those of the SNES game Super Metroid, but other aspects of gameplay are considerable different. While Super Metroid has the player focus on collecting necessary weapons and upgrades in a set order, Phantom 2040 instead makes upgrades optional and has the player focus on following the story of the 24th Phantom, who the player controls. However, this style of game progression draws the game back to Super Metroid's style, due to the way further locations are unlocked as the game goes on without previous locations becoming unavailable. At several points in the storyline, players can make a direct choice about which path they take.

Also like Super Metroid, Phantom 2040 has a heavy emphasis on exploration. Each area is colourful, distinct and vast, and it is up to the player to locate the area's objective or exit. Some areas are larger and more expansive than others, and every area offers large amounts of optional exploration to recover helpful restoration kits or powerful weapon upgrades. Some areas are locked by numbered gates that must be opened by destroying the remote lock of the same number, located elsewhere in that area (additionally, some locks can only be accessed if the area is reached by a secret underground network of sewer systems which connect every area). Most exploration is completely optional, and players can go directly to complete the area's objective, which may include locating a keycard, dealing with a boss or simply finding access to the next area. The majority of areas can all be revisited at the player's leisure anytime after they are unlocked.

This game is full of action packed figh..... no, but is teeming with interesting storyli..... no, but it's got such awesome wea..... Well, ok, pretty much this is a game of putting together jigsaw puzzles, but it's still a fun game. Play against the computer or see if you're faster than your friends in 2 player vs mode.

Pieces is a fun game with cartoonish graphics (except for the almost realistic pictures on the puzzles you're building). The music in this game is good, but only plays during the Title and Menu screen and is replaced by interesting sound effects for the actual gameplay. This game is fun ad I recommend it for the puzzle fan.

Directions:

Pieces is fun and simple, just finish three puzzles before your opponent does. Play against a series of computer opponents that progressively get harder, or play against your friend to see who is better. You are timed, based on how quickly you get a piece in place. If you let the time run out, then you lose power. Your power lets you attack your opponents by slowing them down, removing pieces, or reversing their directional pad. Watch out though, they can do the same to you.

You also have aids that will tell you where a piece might go by telling you three possibilities, or it will tell you which way to go with the piece to give you some idea as to where it goes.

All in all, that's pretty much how the game is played. So sit down, Log in, and Have fun! 

Controls:

A Button - GRAB / SET PUZZLE PIECE / ACTION
B Button - NOTHING
X Button - NOTHING
Y Button - NOTHING
Start Button - PAUSE
Select Button - NOTHING

Tips:

Stealing Pieces
Hold B until the pointer begins to flash. Then, select a piece from your opponent's field and press A to release it.

WELCOME TO THE FLIGHT CLUB

Thank you for selecting our Flight Club over the many other aviation schools that are available. At The Flight Club you can experience and master a variety of aerial activities.

When each lesson is satisfactorily passed, we issue a license in accordance with your technical level. We hope that our students will come enjoy the free, elegant feeling of flying like a bird, that we here at the Flight Club have come to know. To achieve this, let us first begin with learning and applying some practical flight skills.

--From the SNES Pilotwings instruction manual.

Overview:

Pilotwings, along with F-Zero, is well-known for extensive use of the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 graphics, which allows rotation, scaling, and various other effects to be used on a flat image to create a 3D effect. This made Pilotwings one of the coolest looking games to date. The sounds were pretty good too. There plenty of sound effects that add to the realness of the game. The controls are explained to you before every mission and they are responsive enough to make the flight experience a good one. The storyline is simple, become the best pilot you can and if you get good enough you'll be asked to fly a real mission. If you like flight sims, be sure to give this oldie but goodie a try.

Directions:

The game takes place in a series of training areas. In each area there is a number of events that can be tackled in any order. In these events, the player controls one of four different aerial vehicles and must complete a task (usually flying through various floating markers) within a time limit.

Upon completion or failure of the task, the player gets points and comments from the instructors. Points are awarded on criteria such as time to complete the event, accuracy of the landing, and completion of the task. To complete the training area, the combined scores from each event must exceed a certain threshold. Each training area can be attempted as often as necessary, and passwords allow the player to return to a stage.

After four training areas, the player is called upon to fly an attack helicopter on a mission which, if successful, will earn the Pilotwings. This leads to harder training areas (consisting of several weather conditions and higher score requirements) and another helicopter mission. This mode is known as Pilotwings EXPERT.

Controls:

A Button - Speed up (in some activities)
B Button - Slow down (in some activities)
X Button - Not used
Y Button - Not used
L Button - Not used
R Button - Toggle between side and overhead view (in some activities)
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Pick "Start" or "Continue"

Hints:

Birdman Bonus Level
To get to a birdman bonus level, use the hang-glider to land on the target that is normally used for skydiving or the rocketbelt. This will give you full points for your landing and allow you to play a birdman bonus game where you can earn more extra points.

Penguin Diving Bonus Level
To get to this one, land on the moving target that goes around the stationary one during the skydiving activity. This is quite difficult to do. The only way I have ever done it is by continually loading a state with the emulator right before I land, and even then it took me a while.

Bouncing Wingman Bonus Level
Do the same thing as the hint above, except during the rocketbelt activity. This ones a little easier to get to, but still difficult.

Alternate Title Screen
In order to get the other title screen, you must complete the first 4 lessons and Secret Command 1. The new title screen is a city background at night.

Bonus Levels
Bird Fly 
Make a landing on the 'normal' Skydiving/Rocket belt platform on Hang gliding.

Lights on in secret mission
When doing the secret missions at night, hold down the X button and the screen will light up.

Its four tables each had a theme, as do most real life pinball machines. Although Nightmare was nominally the most difficult, it usually gave out the highest scores of all due to bonuses such as double score. The version of Pinball Dreams bundled with the Amiga 1200 had a bug which rendered most of Beat Box's advanced features non-functional.

 - Ignition, themed around a rocket launch, planets, and space exploration.
     - The Expert Software Pinball 2000 port of the game renamed this table Rocket.
 
 - Steel Wheel, themed around steam trains and the Old West.
     - This table borrowed its design from the "Bad Cats" pinball machine.
 
 - Beat Box, themed around the music industry, charts, bands and tours.
 
 - Nightmare, themed around a graveyard, ghosts, demons, nightmares and generally evil things.
     - This table borrowed its design from the "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" pinball machine.
     - Unlike the other tables in the game, the name of the table in the menu did not reflect the name displayed on the table itselfGraveyard. Some ports of the game (notably the GameTek port to the Game Boy) name this table "Graveyard" in the menu as well.

_________________________

Pinball Fantasies contains four themed tables with various difficulty levels.

 - Party Land is a table oriented around an amusement park, where the letters of either PARTY or CRAZY must be lit to start a high-scoring event. This is the easiest table due to several high scoring targets such as the Arcade and the Loop Ramp. This is the table included in the shareware release.

 - Speed Devils is focused on car racing, and the player must overtake cars to take the lead. This is more difficult due to much fewer high-scoring targets.

 - Billion Dollar Gameshow is a gameshow-style table where the player attempts to win prizes by achieving certain combinations of ramps. This is the most difficult, as if the player loses the ball before winning the jackpot the prizes are lost.

 - Stones 'N Bones is based on a haunted house, where the player must go through different modes of play (by hitting targets spelling out "Stone" and "Bone"), with the later modes scoring more points. This is generally considered the highest-scoring table. It is similar in theme to Nightmare in Pinball Dreams.

On his first day at MGM, Pink manages to wreck a scene starring the hot-tempered Inspector Clouseau. Not one to take injury lightly, Clouseau sets off on a hunt to foil Pink's chances at stardom!

The ever-resourceful panther races around the backlot, bombarded by rowdy cowboy boots, nutty squirrels and too-ripe turkey stuffing. He fights back with a bug sprayer full of "pink" and handy gadgets from his Bag of Tricks. He creates chaos on every movie set he dives into, from Pinkinhood to Pink Chill to Cat on a Hot Pink Roof But will his big break ever come?

--From the SNES Pink Goes to Hollywood instruction manual.

Tips:

Invincibility
Hold down the L button on the second controller. For as long as you have the L button held, you will be invincible.

Level Skip
Pause the game with Start, then press Select. You'll automatically go to the next level.

Float in air
Plug in a second controller. Then press B. You will notice Pink flying.

Slow Motion
Not a useful game play trick, but it's fun to play around with. During gameplay, have a second controller plugged into the game console. Anytime during play, press and hold the R button on the second controller.  The game will almost look as if it was paused, but if you watch long enough you'll notice it's just in super slow motion.

Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1992
Developer: THQ
Publisher: THQ
Players: 1 or 2 VS
_________________________

The player begins Pit-Fighter by choosing one of the three playable characters, who all have different moves, speed, and power. As many as three people can play at a time, but there will be extra opponents to fight during any of this game's 15 different matches.

Every third fight is known as a Grudge Match. In a Grudge Match, the player must fight against a CPU controlled clone of his or her fighter (if playing alone) or the other players in a multiplayer game. Each player has three "knockdowns" - getting knocked down three times eliminates them from the Grudge Match, the winner is the last man standing. This match plays more like a bonus round, in that there is only results are gaining or failing to gain bonus money, losing the Grudge Match does not eliminate a player.

The final battle, the "Championship Match", is between the player and the mysterious entity that taunts between matches every once in a while, the Masked Warrior. If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him.

The player must jump, punch, and kick their opponent until his/her energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at a time, the character will perform a "super move".

Sometimes during matches the player will come across foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at you or your opponent. The player may also come across a power-up known as the "power pill". If the player or the opponent grab this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits.

Sometimes even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man and Knife Woman, will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit. Sometimes there is also a fat bearded man with a stick. If the player knocks him down, the player can take the stick and use it against the current opponent.

The audience will also push any fighter that ends up among them, and stays there more than a few seconds. They will be forced back into the fighting area.

Comedic Value:

Fans of this game consider it a classic, often due not only due to groundbreaking technology used to model characters but also due to an unquantifiable fun factor that is derived from the high level of (Possibly unintentional) campiness or tongue-in-cheek humor present in the game. Whether intentional or not the game characters represent many over-the-top stereotypes. For instance Kato, the martial artist, let's out a cry much like Bruce Lee's. The introductory movie at the beginning of the game features him breaking wooden boards and standing on a cliff overlooking a sunset much like what's seen in various martial arts movies. Kato also bows after performing a special combo. The bow takes so long that the enemy has time to get up and perform a move or combo which is frustrating for some but hilarious to others as bowing is at times a source of ridicule in Western media. 

Buzz, an over-muscled jock and former pro wrestler wears eye paint, can be seen lifting weights in the introductory movie and after a special move he swings from side-side while flexing his biceps and saying "The best!". Due to poor sound quality it sounds comically like "Da Big!". While this pose is much shorter than Kato's it can sometimes lead to the enemy performing a special move of their own. For instance while Buzz is posing an enemy such as Chainman Eddie can get up, put him in a choke and punch him across the room.

The game features a weird collision detection as character's bounce incredibly high and far after hitting the ground and can cause damage to other characters while bouncing off the ground. Chainman Eddie's head ram move sometimes causes the character to fly unrealistically fast and far to the point where the character slams against the games invisible border or lands off-screen somewhere in the crowd. If timed right and if both characters are in the right position a special move can result in both characters flying through the air while going through the animation of a special move. Also if timed right the audience may push a character at the same time that a throw or special such as Buzz's suplex are being performed. This results in both characters going through the animation but Buzz also slides across the screen and the enemy is suspended in mid-air by an unseen force before slamming into the ground.

The element of camp again comes into play when examining several outrageous character designs and traits. Chainman Eddie seems to be the most eggregious offender. His outfit is comprised of two chains wrapped over his shoulders and across his body in an x pattern, no shirt and a pair of very short white shorts which look like large briefs or an adult diaper. One fan-made website is partially dedicated to the idea that a Pitfighter sequel should include Chainman Eddie as the focal point. A pseduo final stage requires the player to beat two Chainman Eddie's at once. If the player dies, the character model disappears from sight but the two Eddie's attack the invisible character and often wind up hurting or killing one another which causes the boss in the background to react with outrage and threaten to kill you despite the fact that you're already dead. His taunt consists of him putting his hands on his hips and guffawing like a mad scientist leaving him open to attack. 

The pseudo boss stage starts with both Eddie's chained in the background. They escape or break their shackles, jump onto the playable area and guffaw. The player can take advantage of this moment and smash a barrel over one of the Eddie's head while the other laughs idiotically.

Almost every character possesses a taunt or sound byte which provides senseless humor. For instance the main boss known simply as The Warrior pronounces "You Die!" at several points in the game, snorts like a pig, and let's out a weird garbled sounding squeel. Chainman Eddie has the aforementioned guffaw. Mad Miles taunts "Come on punk!", spits on the player or, when he gets beaten badly enough, exclaims "I'm mad!" while pulling out a knife. After performing a special, Buzz flexes and exclaims "The best!", Kato let's out a Bruce Lee scream before bowing very slowly and Ty punches excitedly into the air while yelling "Yea!". The audience also yells random nonsense which includes "Get over here.", "Yo! Brotha!" "Stop it!" and "Alright!", along with other indecipherible taunts and phrases.

In am online review of the movie Pit Fighter, which was not an adaptation of the game, one writer lamented the absence of C.C. Rider, a character in the game while another admitted that he mainly watched the movie hoping it would be an adaptation of the game.

In this game, the player takes the role of Pitfall Harry Jr., son of the hero of the original game, who has to find his kidnapped father.

An extra feature in all versions is the ability to play the original Pitfall! (the Atari 2600 version) after finding a secret doorway. The doorway can be found by looking for something that seems out of place. The Sega CD, 32X and Windows ports contained extra (and expanded) levels and other enhancements over the earlier versions. The Windows port was based on the Sega CD version, and made using Kinesoft's Exodus game technology, which was later used to make the Windows port of Earthworm Jim: Special Edition.

On April 13, 2009, the Sega Genesis version of Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure was released on the Virtual Console in North America and later in the PAL regions on May 15, 2009.

Everyone knows that Plok is simply crazy about flags (of course you do!). He has them everywhere. He uses them to mark out which parts of Akrillic (he thinks) belongs to him. His flags are all over the place!

Now, what you may not know is that Plok has a particular favorite flag, a big square one with a picture of himself on it. He keeps this special flag on top of his own house so that he can see it every day when he gets up and every night when he returns from a hard day of... uh, of being Plok!

If you were a despicable character and you wanted to upset Plok or get him out of the way for some reason, what would you do? Hide his special flag? Well, that's exactly what happened today!

Somebody, he doesn't know who, has stolen his special flag and placed it on nearby Cotton Island. As you can imagine, Plok is hopping mad about this. First thing this morning he set off in his boat to retrieve his property. But knowing Plok, he's not gonna leave it at that. Nope, no way!

Anyway, that's the story so far, but there may be more to this business than meets the eye...

Pocky & Rocky
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Action , Top Down , Multi-Directional
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Natsume
Publisher: Natsume
Players: 2
_________________________
*
Set in Feudal Japan, Pocky & Rocky has the player assume the role of a young girl who, while tending to a shrine one night, is visited by Rocky, a tanuki and member of a group of yokai known as the "Nopino Goblins", all of whom have recently been driven insane by an unknown force. Together, Pocky and Rocky must travel through several levels consisting of various ancient Japanese locales while battling a number of creatures from popular Japanese myth, including kappas, obake, and yurei. Eventually, they must breach the stronghold of the mysterious Black Mantle, who has been using these monsters (collectively referred to as the "Gorgonzola Goblins") to fulfill his evil deeds. Whichever character the player chooses to play will make no difference in the outcome of the story.

Pocky & Rocky takes place from a top-down perspective with the characters moving either horizontally or vertically through a level while defeating approaching enemies and destroying obstacles that may block the player's path. Pocky can use her o-fuda talismans (simply called "cards" in the English language version) to attack enemies from afar, or purification rod, which she swings at a wide arc, to hit ones close up. Likewise, Rocky can throw leaves across the screen or quickly turn his backside towards the enemy and swing his tail from side to side. By holding the short-ranged attack button down and then releasing it, Pocky does a spinning attack that can hit any enemy around her, while Rocky is able to transform into a statue, rendering him invulnerable to all attacks for a short time while leaving him immobile. Both characters can also slide across the ground, covering an area quickly. 

If a player bumps into the other while sliding, it will cause them to spin out of control across the screen, damaging any enemies they come in contact with, though the initial bump causes some damage to the receiving character. A limited-use special attack can be used to hit several or all the enemies present on the screen, and is only available once per life (they differ in actual range and power between the two characters). Though most enemies only require a few attacks to defeat, boss monsters present at the end of each level take much more, and may require an additional use of strategy.

Various power-ups can also be acquired that will increase the effectiveness of either Pocky or Rocky's attacks, such as making their projectiles larger or giving them the ability to throw multiple ones at once. Others include the ability to become invincible, or regain hit points, giving them more endurance. Each item obtained will add to the player's total score, and when a certain amount is reached, they are given an additional life, another chance to complete the current level.

Three levels of difficulty can be selected before a player begins the game: easy, normal or hard. Selecting a higher difficulty will make the enemy creatures more difficult to defeat and provide a higher challenge to the player, as well as increase the number of hits required to defeat a boss. Defeating the game on a harder mode will not yield any greater ending or reward, and it is merely for the player's own gameplay preference.

_________________________

Another top-down shooter in the Twinbee "cute'em up" franchise.

Heroes Light and Pastel decide to go out and help a young maiden bring sense back to her scientist father, who apparently has bumped his head and transformed into a evil mastermind that seeks world domination.

As the other games in the series Pop'n Twinbee is a vertically-scrolling arcade shooter in which you and a friend get behind the controls of Twinbee and Winbee, the cutest starfighters ever created, and try to clear stage after stage of enemies with your weapons. Being a console original instead of a port, Pop'n features a number of additions to the gameplay mechanics, including an energy bar, eight difficulty levels and a handicap feature when playing with a friend (which makes most enemies target one fighter instead of the other).

The upgrade system remains consistent with the series's: you shoot colored bells which give different power-ups when collected, including multiple shots, "options" and shield energy. Also when correctly powered-up both fighters can join and perform powerful team-up moves.

Tips:

Press pause during a game and enter the following codes:

To deal with the many villains Dr. Warmon throws at you, you need to collect colored bells. Depending on the color of the bell you can use different attacks like a laser (blue bells) or a lash (orange bells). But even without the bells you're not defenseless. Your standard-attacks include a shock wave and the ability to fly.

You are a supreme being...with the power to command the forces of nature. Earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, the power to turn the very oceans into fertile plains or the plains into barren rock is yours. But such power is not limitless. Its source is in the number of your followers--the followers of Good--scattered on worlds throughout the universe. These people look to you to level their land so they can raise their crops, build towns and multiply. In return, as their number increases, so does your power to smite the enemy, the followers of Evil.

The forces of darkness threaten to engulf every world in the universe. Your followers will be overrun and you with them, unless you help them prosper and grow, unless you call them to glory, to conquest, to purge the worlds of Evil.

With enough power you can move the Good Papal Magnet. Place it anywhere in the world and your followers will be drawn to it, cultivating the land as they go, or confronting Evil. Make the Good people's Leader into a crusading Knight, and he will invade the enemy, attacking their people, burning towns and crops.

Victory depends on the elimination of Evil. Send your people to hunt them down. Wreak havoc on them with the forces of nature. Wipe them off the face of the world, or if Good outnumbers Evil, call for Armageddon. Every person--Good and Evil--will come together for the final doomsday battle.

From world to world you must go, aiding your followers, destroying the enemy. The landscapes will become increasingly formidable, the power of Evil ever greater.

The Good depend on you to triumph.

Oblivion awaits the loser...

--From the SNES Populous instruction manual.

Overview:

The endless struggle between Good and Evil. In Populous, take control as the deity of Good, guiding your people as they confront the forces of Evil across hundreds of different landscapes.

Directions:

It's a classical religious synergy. Use your wisdom to guide, and your control over Nature to help more directly, as you build up your followers to become stronger and more, well... Populous. In turn, you gain more power and influence from the strength and numbers of your followers.

Controls:

A Button - Make selections, Raise Land
B Button - Make selections, Lower Land
X Button - Flatten Land around Settlement
Y Button - Locate Settlements
Start Button - Start and Pause Game
Select Button - Access Command Icons

Hints:

Knights!
A Knight is perhaps your primary weapon against Evil, as he actively seeks them out to destroy them. When you want to attack, you need the strongest Knight possible. Move your Papal Magnet to a position near the enemy land you wish to attack (remember you need a leader to do this). Then set your Influence to Go To Magnet(arrow pointing to Ankh). Use the Question Mark Icon to set the shield on the leader (first one to touch the Magnet if there wasn't one already). Watch the shield until it shows a full yellow bar for your leader, then use the Knight spell. The resulting Knight will be almost impossible to kill. It may take a little while but it's worth the wait. Also remember not to leave your Influence on that setting forever, because your walkers will never settle again.

Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods

Genre: Strategy
Release Year: 1991
Developer: Bullfrog Productions
Publisher: Imagineer
Players: 1
_________________________

Populous II is a direct sequel to Bullfrog's earlier game Populous and is one of the company's most famous games. Like its predecessor, Populous II is a god game, where the player takes the role of a god, guiding his people in battle against the followers of an enemy god.

Whereas Populous only generally alluded to undefined deities, Populous II is specifically set under the backdrop of Greek mythology. The player is a demigod, one of Zeus's countless children with mortal women, and has to battle one Greek deity at a time until finally facing his father. Zeus has promised to let the player into the Pantheon on Olympus if he can survive all the battles.

Populous II is considerably more versatile and has a great deal more "divine intervention" effects than the original game. Populous would only bestow eight powers on the player but the sequel, Populous II has twenty-nine. These are sub-divided into six categories of effect: earth, water, wind, fire, plants and people. The six categories has an individual "manna meter" which needs to be filled to a certain level to enable specific powers for usage. Manna is generated by population existing over time - the larger the population, the more manna is generated. Use of a power will deplete a set amount of manna and repeated use of the more devastating powers will empty the manna reservoir.

Similar to the "knight" effect in Populous, each effect category includes a "hero", allowing the player to transform his leader into one of six legendary figures in Greek mythology who will wander around the map attacking enemies or perform some other nefarious act.

If either side controlled a certain percentage of the map, usually 75%, ancient Greek monsters would be unleashed upon the map, such as the Colossus or Medusa which would wander from one side to another leaving a train of destruction in their wake. This was usually seen as a cue to hurry up and complete the map because the monsters were indestructible and were indiscriminate in who they killed.

Upon the successful completion of a map, the player will be awarded between one and five small experience points depending on scale of victory, number and types of powers used and length of battle which can then be used to boost capabilities in any of the six categories. This will improve accuracy and duration of powers and reduce the amount of manna needed to activate abilities.

The home computer versions features 1000 maps and the player would advance to the next map depending on performance in the battle - an exceptional performance would allow the player to skip several maps, a poorer performance would only see a smaller advance. The console versions eliminated this, having only a set number of maps available to play.

A data disk was also released for Populous II, called Populous II: The Challenge Games. This was set in Japanese mythology instead of Greek, and had each level as its individual challenge, slightly in the style of a puzzle game.

Populous II is being remade and remastered for the Nintendo DS, due for release in 2008.

"Before Sega Rally, there was Power Drive."

Rage Software are not immediately associated with first-rate interactive entertainment; in fact, most of their stuff I've played on various platforms was pretty bland and uninspired. But amidst all these mediocre games lies an early, 1994-vintage gem that is as bright as it is obscure: Power Drive. Driving is already a direly underrepresented genre on the SNES, but when one of the very few decent games on the system is this rare and at the same time this good, it needs and deserves all the attention it can get - albeit a good ten years after its release. In case you're not in the mood for reading, here's the potted version of the review below: this isometric-perspective racer has great, fully customisable controls, 6 real-life cars and an 8-player party mode. Good luck finding it!

No, really, if people knew about it, Power Drive would surely be fetching the same sums as Final Fight and Castlevania V. It took me a good few months to track it down after I learned that it was released for the SNES (I played it on the PC when it first came out) but when I finally did, I got it for pennies because no-one else was interested. As there is no info on the game whatsoever on the web, the gamers are simply unaware that they're missing on a great rally/rally cross hybrid with six real-life cars that look the part and control like a dream, especially the four-wheel drive ones. The game may in places lack the polish that separates a major release from a minor one, but there being so much tangible enthusiasm and passion behind this well-coded effort, the home-brew feel (particularly to the interface) makes the experience of the game that bit more authentic.

Once in the game, the graphics improve dramatically. Some may sneer at the car sprites, which, apart from the Mini and the Cinquecento, are not instantly identifiable with the vehicles they're supposed to represent, but with full sprite rotation and tilt, and screen scrolling that is smooth as silk in every direction, diagonals included, this is a minor gripe. Occasionally, there is a bit of flicker when the guide arrows and another sprite, either the opponent car or the headlights - each beam is animated separately, which gives a beautiful and realistic effect - overlap, but again, this never gets in the way of the gameplay and is therefore hardly something that could actually be held against the game. The backgrounds, i.e. the tracks and the scenery, take into account general landscape characteristics of each country and are executed with obvious taste and attention to detail, further contributing to the overall visual excellence of the game.

The sound department, too, fits the feel of the game. The music is pure early 90's, and its gritty samples and simple but catchy melodies are reminiscent of the Amiga tracker-scene. It's mixed in somewhat too loud during the race - I prefer to race without any music at all, but as the game only has global on/off switches, I leave it on - so that the already weak engine noise and other incidental sounds tend to get drowned in it. It's by no means a catastrophe, mind you; there isn't a manual transmission option anyway (eliminating the need to pay attention to the sound of the engine), so it really boils down to personal preference.

Another minor complaint is that each sub-menu is associated with a different tune, meaning that every time you need to change a setting, a new song will play and with most of them, you'll only ever hear ten seconds of it - a shame, really, as they're mostly excellent. A song chosen at random playing through without interruption would seem to me a better idea, but again, this is more of a remark than a salient complaint.

Power Drive's game mechanics are simple - though they do allow advanced driving manoeuvres - but with the stages being quite demanding and the guide arrows often imprecise, every bit of concentration (and some memorisation) is needed in order to progress and attain the coveted Power Drive World Champion title. Easy to pick up but difficult to master, the game can be fiendishly challenging, especially if you are racing against a computer-controlled opponent on a hazardous course but if you make that (near-)perfect run, you will emerge victorious.

AI is very advanced for a game of this age: not only is there no catch up, computer-controlled drivers also make mistakes, especially under pressure - a feature that's absent even from numerous current-generation racing games, including the so-called Real Driving Simulator. Damage that the cars take by colliding with the scenery and each other cannot be seen but it can certainly be felt as the performance degrades quite dramatically, especially after head-on crashes at high speed. Subsequent repairs can eat dangerously into your budget and may even prevent you from upgrading to a better class of cars - which, in turn, cost even more to maintain. Particularly in the final stages of the game, precision driving and judicious use of power-ups (speaking of which, a "toolbox" power-up would've been a really nice feature) are thus crucial to winning.

For me, one of the most important qualities in a game is that, while hard, it's clearly possible to beat; only this way can you be sure that by spending hours on honing a skill, you're not wasting time but rather inching towards perfection. Power Drive is a fair game most of the time with no glaring technical imperfections to get in the way or distract the player from the intense on-screen action. There is an annoying bug in the password code that charges you the initial stage entry fee twice, however, and while I'm OK with the .5-second penalty incurred by hitting traffic cones often found on tricky corners and in skill tests, the fact that you get repeatedly penalised for hitting the same cone means that the game is essentially over if one gets caught in front of the car, which is frustrating. Still, the pros by far outweigh the cons and the Power Drive development team can only be congratulated on a great game that deserved much more recognition than it got both from the press and the gaming public. 

I suggest you help make this wrong right by seeking out a copy of the game and giving it a go.

The Goketsuji clan . . . Every five years, a hand-to-hand combat tournament is held to determine who is the strongest fighter.

The fighter is then chosen to become the leader of the Goketsuji clan.

Anyone who is a descendant of the Goketsuji clan may enter.

Their present leader, Oume Goketsuji, has defended her reign for over 60 years.

To all entrants, an attendant named Kuroko is assigned to take care of all their needs.

Once again, the present leader, 78 year old Oume, will attempt to defend her title.

However, this time around, Oume's younger sister Otane, who ran away from home years ago, has also entered the tournament as well and she seeks to defeat Oume so that she can gain control over the Goketsuji clan.

Only the strong will survive this fight!

Overview:

The Power Instinct series (often abbreviated as PI or GI for short) is renowned for its more humorous take on fighting games, its music and its often-weird characters.

One of the innovations unique to the series was the introduction of the transformation feature. Several of the characters can change their appearance and fighting style by simply executing certain moves (usually a throwing move), though this has not been featured in every entry in the series. Other features include the ability to perform a double jump and attacking while dashing.

Gameplay:

The game uses a four button layout, two buttons for punches and two for kicks. Every character has their own stage, attacks and special moves. The special moves are performed via combinations of joystick movements and buttons.

All the stages are wider than they look. When the objects in the corners are broken, the stage itself is expanded upon, making a bigger playing field.

The player will fight against all the characters and, every four matches, will have the chance to play one of two bonus stages. One of them consists of knocking away Kurokos who run into the screen, and the other involves breaking jars tossed from around the screen in certain orders.

When all the characters have been defeated, the player will go on to face Oume, the current clan leader, and once she is defeated, the ending for that character is shown.

Power Moves (Super Nintendo's version name), or Deadly Moves (Sega Genesis's version name), both versions known in Japan as Power Athlete, is a fighting game created by Kaneko. One of the many fighting games published in the early 90's to capitalize on the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II, it did not achieve the success of its competition, and was largely ignored by most gamers.

The gameplay is that of a traditional head-to-head fighting game. But unlike most games of its type, the single-player mode is limited to one character, Joe, who is the protagonist of the game. One of the game's most distinctive aspects is an RPG-like system which enables the player to boost Joe's various attributes, such as strength, speed and endurance. Another gimmick is the use of a two-plane fighting area (similar to that of Fatal Fury).

Trivia:

- Despite the difference in name for the Genesis and Super Nintendo versions, there was no actual difference in gameplay, content or characters. However, it is widely believed that the game's box cover and title were renamed only to keep up with Nintendo's stringent no-violence policy, as the Genesis cart features a closeup of a character being punched in the face, with a torrent of blood erupting from the impact. The SNES version's box featured the same image, with the red blood re-colored to look like sweat (the same tactic used with Mortal Kombat).

- Although the Genesis version known as "Deadly Moves" featured a blood-spattered cover, there was no blood or finishing moves of any kind in the game.

- The US magazine ad for the game, while detailing its features, did not feature any actual screenshots from the game, but crudely drawn ones that did not resemble the game at all.

Power Piggs of the Dark Age is a side-scrolling action Super NES game that takes place during the Dark Ages. As a group of humanoid pigs, the object is to defeat a warlord who happens to be a humanoid wolf. Each of the Power Piggs uses his own medieval weapon and uses it to defeat minor enemies that lie in his path. The first stage is a typical medieval town but it only gets more surreal from there. Doughnuts are seen as food in the game for the main characters (as it is depicted in the title screen logo).

Powermonger takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.

Powerslide is a Super FX supported game that was also in development for the Jaguar and 3DO. It was being developed by Elite, an English game company. This preview shot was taken from the German magazine, Nintendo Fun Vision (issue 5). According to Steve Wilcox of Elite, the game was cancelled because the cost of producing cartridges for the game was too high to make a return on the costs of software development.

MatthewCallis released a ROM image of a demo from the ECTS gaming show (essentially the European equivalent to E3 back in the 90s). As of writing, it is not yet supported in emulators, and only displays a static screen.

The game is a simple platform game where the player walks and jumps his/her way through the levels and whacks enemies in the head with a club. Points can be collected by both whacking enemies and collecting items (including food, diamonds, video games, etc). The levels contain hidden food items which can be discovered by hitting the right spots with the club.

The creators added a lot of detail to the game, which indeed increases the entertainment factor. If the player runs for a long distance and then stops, the caveman will be out of breath. Also, without drinking for a long time, the caveman's lips will turn purple.

Controlling the game is very simple, with only the four arrow keys for movement and the space bar as attack button.

Tips:

Stage Select/Skip
From the title screen, choose 'Options'. Highlight the 'Exit' option, then hold L and press Start. Back at the title screen, with 'Game Start' highlighted, hold R and press Start. The game will begin.

To access the stage select screen, press Start to pause the game, then press Select. Choose a stage from the list (there are more pages if you scroll down) and press B or Start to begin there.

To skip to the next level (or to see the ending when you're at the last level) press Select during gameplay.

Pretty Soldier Sailer Moon
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge

Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1999
Original Title: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Another Story
Translated By: Bishoujo Senshi Translations
Version: 1.00
_________________________

Yep, it's a Sailor Moon RPG. Pretty nifty, huh? The game is pretty standard I guess; there are some pretty cool things in it though, like the nifty techniques and stuff. However, it is pretty hard to make sense of things (especially in the beginning) without a good knowledge of the series; the game continues the unfortunate "You'd damn well better know who everyone is before you play, cause no way in hell are we going to explain it to you" syndrome of anime gaming. Of course, this game isn't meant for just your average Joe guy, it's meant for people who like Sailor Moon. So, uhh, there you go.

Translation Description:

To further confuse things for most Cartoon Network-lovers who haven't seen the subtitled anime, this translation uses the Japanese names. Serena becomes Usagi, etcetc. Even with the patch's included liner notes, it's still confusing. But whose fault is that? Not theirs! Blame Cartoon Network! Those name-changing sons of bitches! Sure, they didn't do it themselves, but hey, who else are you gonna blame?

As for the translation itself, it is nothing short of astounding. FuSoYa has done a superb job, even adding new code for a variable width font which looks really nice. Even the signs have been translated, which is a really nice touch. Of all the people I've talked to who played this game, even the ones who hated the game were still very impressed with the translation's degree of professionalism. Which is saying a lot, knowing all the assholes that I know.

Hints:

Use Same Character in 2P Mode
When the cursor is on Player 2, hold down L and R, and push Start. Now both players can select the same character.

Tips:

Begin game with level 99 characters and mostly 255 stats
Hold A on controller 2 and on controller 1 press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right

Senshi start at level 16
Press and hold the X button at the Title Screen then start a new game.

This game is your typical Beat'em Up fare, except you get to kick ass with the Sailor Moon girl of your choice.

Like most Beat'em Ups, you have your basic attack, hold, and unblockable move that hurts you if it connects. You also have a limited amount of super moves that will instantly kill any non-boss enemy on the screen.

Graphically, the game is pretty decent, as is the sound, but the animation doesn't really seem all that fluid, which makes a lot of attacks look jerky.

As for the difficulty, it's laughable at first, but by the time you get to the Crystal Tokyo stage the game becomes merciless. Unless you pull out some sweet Sailor Kung Fu, soon your last continue will be gone and the Black Moon UFO will triumph. Tuxedo Mask would be ashamed!

Translation Description:

Even though most Brawlers aren't very text heavy, what's translated in this patch is very good. All the text formatting behaves like it should, and no engrish was witnessed in playing the patch. This last fact alone makes it better than 98% of SNK's official translations.

Overall it's a very nice piece of work.

Tips:

More Chibiusa modes
In the main menu, put the cursor on the 'Chibiusa' mode. Hold L and R while you press Start.

"In the future... civilization died... in the cataclysms. The Draconians were born... from the death... of old earth. Who will rule the new Urth?"

Primal Rage is basically Street Fighter with monsters. Choose from seven monsters (some which are clones of each other) and claw your way through the opponents in story mode, train in training mode, or battle your friend in 2P mode.

Compared to the Genesis version, this has both advantages and disadvantages. Yet both have strong disadvantages compared to the original arcade version.

Directions:

Conquer "Urth" as one of seven huge beasts. Dominating other beasts and gaining worshippers along the way.

As the title suggests, the game is set in Ancient Persia. One day, the Sultan of Persia went to wage war in a foreign land, and his vizier, Jaffar, is left to rule in his stead. Jaffar locks the nameless protagonist up because the Princess, Jaffar's love interest, has taken an interest in him. Jaffar then locks up the Princess herself, giving her an ultimatum; marry Jaffar, or die within the hour.

The player character is a nameless protagonist from a foreign country who traveled to Persia. The protagonist falls in love with the Princess of Persia. The primary antagonist of the game is Jaffar, the Vizier of Persia, who imprisons the Princess and attempts to conquer the land while her father is away.

The nameless protagonist escapes his prison, and climbs to the top of the tower, to where the Princess is imprisoned, facing a variety of resistance along the way. The Princess' room is guarded by Jaffar, whom the Prince defeats, saving Persia, and rescuing the Princess.

Tips:

Cheat Menu
Go to the password screen and input the word 'special'.  You'll hear the sound of Prince being hit and nothing
else will happen. Exit this screen and start a new game. Pause the game and then press buttons in this order: B, Y, Up, Down, Left, Right, L, R, then press Start + Select to enter the cheat menu. In the cheat menu you have level select, sound select and boost meter, which increases by one, as many times as you wish, the maximum amount of life you have. Also, during any battle, if you press X, the enemy you are facing will die.

Note: this code does not work for the PAL version of the game.

When playing, press and hold start, then select.

Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow & The Flame
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1996
Developer: Titus Software
Publisher: Titus Software
_________________________
*
Similar to the first Prince of Persia, the character explores various deadly areas by running, jumping, crawling, avoiding traps, solving puzzles and drinking magic potions. Prince of Persia 2 is, however, more combat-heavy than its predecessor. In the first game, enemies appear only occasionally and are always alone, while in the sequel, up to four enemies may appear at once, sometimes flanking the player, and may even be instantly replaced by reinforcements when they are killed. As in Prince of Persia, the trick is to complete the game under a strict time limit that passes in real time. Lives are unlimited, but time cannot be regained except by reverting to a previously saved game. In other areas, more significant improvements have been made. The graphics are far more complex than the simple look of the game's predecessor, the areas explored are larger, and the variety of backdrops is greater.

Setting:

The game takes place eleven days after the events of Prince of Persia, in Persia, as well as various other locations. During this period of eleven days, the Prince was hailed as a hero who defeated the evil Jaffar. He turns down all riches and instead asks for the Princess' hand in marriage as his reward, to which the Sultan of Persia reluctantly agrees.

Plot:

Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame begins as the Prince enters the royal courts of the palace. Before he enters, however, his appearance turns back into that of a beggar. Nobody recognizes him, and when he attempts to speak with the Princess, a man who shares his appearance (apparently Jaffar, magically disguised) emerges from the shadows, ordering him to be thrown out. With guards pursuing him, the Prince jumps through a window and flees the city by way of merchant ship.

The ship is struck by lightning, cast by Jaffar, just as a mysterious woman appears in the barge and asks the Prince to find her. He regains consciousness, and finds himself on the shore of a foreign island.

As the Prince fights his way back to Persia, he finds many useful tools in his quest against Jaffar. At one point the Prince's mother[citation needed], revealed to be the mysterious woman on the ship, shows herself, and explains about her husband's death, and her plight to abandon the Prince so that he might live. In a temple, the Prince finds that he can separate from his body, transforming into the shadow that Jaffar's magic mirror created in the events of Prince of Persia. The Prince uses this motive to steal the sacred flame of the temple, and then travels back to Persia. Here he immediately encounters Jaffar, who flees. The Prince transforms into the shadow bearing the blue flame once again, and casts fire at Jaffar, defeating him. The Princess awakens from the spell Jaffar set upon her, and the Prince orders the former Vizier's ashes be scattered. As the Prince and Princess ride into the distance, however, it is revealed that an old woman is watching them through a crystal ball.

Pro Quarterback is a football game featuring 27 different teams. Since this game doesn't have an NFL or NFLPA license, there aren't any real NFL teams or players here, although the teams included in the game represent the cities of their real life NFL counterparts and also mimic the colors of their team's uniforms.

The games options allow the player to choose to play on 6 different field surfaces (grass, mud, dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf) and to choose how long the game will last (2, 5, 10 or 15 minute quarters). There are also no penalties in this game whatsoever.

Gameplay consists of playing on both offense and defense. There are 26 different offensive plays and 18 different defensive plays to choose from. The game has a down the field view when on offense, so the game doesn't have receivers in windows.

Sometimes you forget how things were prior to the advent of the internet. So many videogames came and went without notice. Pro Sport Hockey is one of these games that never brought in supporters clamoring for a sequel, never impacted the competition, and has for better or worse been ignored since its release in 1994. My attempts to research the game turned up some pretty lame results. A 2.5/5 score in Nintendo Power. And?some screenshots. That's all there was.

For Jaleco Entertainment's sake, we're going to say this wasn't exactly the finished product they had in mind. If PSH were thrown out in the mid-eighties, it would've been par for the course, but this was an NES remake, and the original only came out one year prior to it's release. But, what kind of a difference did that timeframe make?

It must have been improved for the SNES port, right? Well, they did touch a couple things up (or at least touched them). The players took on the resemblance of monkeys, rather than stick figures. It was a step in the right direction. Rather than leaving the ice solid white, with all the appropriate markings drawn in, the ice instead followed a blue and white pattern of coordinating horizontal lines from one end to the other. The perspective took an angled shift, so the nets appeared to be disproportionate to the goalie - this may have also been what threw the feeling of having some kind of presence on the ice off - it's rare that the player ever knows exactly where they're going on the ice or if they're lining up right for a check.

When hell freezes over, it might look a lot like Pro Sport Hockey. It's difficult to come to a game's defense when so little has been done to perpetuate any positive changes. Audio effects still sound as though they're coming from one of the earliest consoles, aside from slightly satisfying organ music which will probably end up being shut off in options, just because the menu music's that grating.

Pro Sport Hockey."An energy system has been implemented in this version, which is probably the best thing the game has going for it. The concept was to wear down the opposition, causing the goalies little positional indicator to turn from blue to flush red. Once sufficiently tired, he'll apparently be incapable of stopping your shots. It's unfortunate, because it makes for scoreless games when you turn off the fatigue feature. Passing is also difficult, as computer players quickly scramble inward, collecting the puck. The same doesn't go for your offensive line, who never makes a feasible attempt to intercept the other team's passes. Energy is also expended with increased physicality, giving players another drawback for fisticuffs and general roughing beyond the penalty box. Yet there's no way to steal the puck without unintentionally putting the player in danger for a penalty or loss of energy. It's also too easy to run into teammates when checking, which can be amusing, but also drains the player.

It would seem that for Pro Sport Hockey's positive attributes, several points have been knocked off of some other category, or the game was manipulated to counter-balance the good changes, making this rendition just as good, if not a little less compelling than the original. When sports games deliver the same thing year after year, fans tend to get upset. When sports games deliver a worse product after what had already been a subpar year in which EA officially launched its killer perennial franchise with NHL 94, you don't have any fans. Without a following of any kind or any interest garnered since its release a mere decade and a half ago, it's pretty clear that Jaleco Entertainment was trying to milk whatever was left from their average NES outing, without doing much to really improve any key area.

THIS GAME IS NO PUSH-OVER

G.I. ANT is a soldier ant. He's extremely clever, and highly trained in tactical maneuvers. What's more, he's extraordinarily strong and super smart! His latest mission is to gain access to the crazy world of Captain Rat's Treasure Caves. Very straightforward..... NOT!

You see, this particular cave is a tunnel entrance to Domino Domain - a mini- world comprised of nine different continents. G.I. must negotiate many screens of mind-teasing problems. Each level has a door to the next. To open the door, the 'Trigger' domino-block must be felled by causing a chain reaction with all of the other domino-blocks in that level. Pretty easy..... NOT!

Putty Squad is a platform game in which the player controls an amorphous blue blob, tasked with rescuing imprisoned putties. The player's putty can stretch in a variety of ways: sidewards to cover ground faster, squash flat to absorb pick-up items, stretch upwards to climb, morph a fist to attack, or inflate to float upwards.

Putty can collect stars that increase his attack power: at first increasing the potency of his punch, but later allowing him to blow darts, electrocute enemies or throw bombs. This star power is reduced every time Putty is hit by an enemy.

Q Bert 3 is an awesome game. It's just like the first one, except the graphics and sound are better. The levels are a lot cooler, too. Q Bert was huge when it first came out, but after a while the buzz about it just kinda died down. It's still an awesome game. The controls on this version weren't the same as they were on the NES. If you are used to playing the NES version, this one will take some getting used to. Q Bert 3 is an awesome game, so give it a try!

Directions:

Jump on the blocks to change them to the desired color. Watch out for enemies! 

Controls:

Use the d-pad do make Q Bert hop in the desired direction. If you go to the options menu, you can set them how you want.

Hints:

Flying Discs
Try not to use your flying discs unless you have to, if you finish the level without using them, you will get bonus points.

Tips:

BYDO RETURNS!

The dark forces of the BYDO Empire threaten humanity yet again, with more powerful weapons than ever. Over the past few years, they have crept close to Earth, building hidden bases for their fleets. The Earth Science Center had believed that all of the BYDO Empire was destroyed. Now they know that somewhere a BYDO mother ship carries the remnants of that foul civilization. Earth will be overthrown unless the latest R-series vessel, the R-90, can defeat BYDO's armies. Equipped with the mighty Round, Shadow, or Cyclone Forces of power, the R-90 can warp into different dimensions and meet the enemy ships and ground troops on an equal basis. As the Captain of the R-90, you must seek out the mysterious mother ship and destroy it to save humanity.

Radical Dreamers
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Satellaview Download
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Adventure , Visual Novel , Fantasy
Release Year: 2005
Original Title: BS Radical Dreamers
Translated By: Neo Demiforce, Radical R
Version: 1.4
_________________________
*
Radical Dreamers is a visual novel set in the Chrono Trigger universe. It is a pseudo-sequel to Chrono Trigger itself, and is commonly referred to as the game that inspired Chrono Cross. This is true to a very great extent, but if you're expecting CC on the SNES or anything even vaguely similar to CC, then you're going to be sorely disappointed. RD plays very much like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel. Text is displayed for a while, and eventually you will be prompted to make a choice based on the text. You navigate the mansion that way, you fight battles that way, and in fact, you do -everything- that way. So if reading isn't your thing, then you're not going to get much enjoyment out of the game. If you like to read, however, you're in for a treat.

At the core of any novel - whether it's pushed as a paperback or hardcover book, a PDF file on some website, or a game like this one - is its story and its writing. Demi's team has gone through great pains to ensure that the writing is second to none; in fact, you could probably pass this off as a major literary work. I can't imagine how many pages it would be if it were printed in book form.

The story is a good one as well, one that Cross fans will be familiar with. It follows Serge, Kid, and Magil through Viper Manor in their quest for the Frozen Flame. They go through a number of interesting rooms, encounter a number of fearsome beasts, and meet a number of interesting people. There's the development of a relationship between Serge and Kid, there's the mysterious past that Kid wants to get revenge for, there's the ever-driving hunt for gold, gold, and more gold. On the whole, it's quite a good read.

Combat, as I mentioned, is text based like the rest of the game. Serge does have "health" and you can "die", and the results of your actions won't always go the same way each time. Each time you get hurt by anything, the game lowers Serge's health a little, and eventually the text accompanying his state of being will alter as well to give you an idea of how badly injured he is. The whole system is nothing really groundbreaking, but it can work against you if you have incredibly bad luck. The game isn't very long though, so hopefully, health won't be an issue.

Graphically and aurally, the game ranges from decent to good. There are a few truly beautifully done areas in the game (most notably the study) but while most of the graphics aren't really anything groundbreaking, they certainly suffice and get the point across. The sound and music fare about the same. Many of the tunes in Radical Dreamers were remixed for use in Cross, so some of them may be familiar while others probably won't. Again, my favorite theme has to be the one that plays in the study.

All in all, if you like reading and you're a Chrono fan, give Radical Dreamers a whirl. It'll fill up an afternoon, anyway, and even if you've managed to get all three endings to the main scenario, there are still six or seven other sub-scenarios that you can read through once you've gone through the main for the first time. I haven't played any of them, though, so I can't say much about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed the main chapter.

RPM was a successful remake of the Commodore 64 program Racing Destruction Set, developed by Electronic Arts in 1985. It claims to be the first American-developed game for the SNES system.

RPM was one of the first SNES games developed in 'High Resolution Graphics Mode' which allowed for sharper detail but fewer colors. While the higher resolution gave finer detail, it also severely limited the number of colors and amount of unique graphics that could be displayed from the SNES video memory. Due to this, the sequel to RPM (RPMII which was later renamed Rock N' Roll Racing) was developed in the lower resolution graphics mode allowing for much more vibrant colors and graphic detail.

The logic engine and track editor for RPM were ported from an older EA title Racing Destruction Set. The 6502 assembly code was modified for 16 bit but otherwise mostly left intact.

There is an easter egg in the game on Track 29 which spells 'Eat Me' very clearly. This surprisingly made it through Nintendo's QA process and wasn't mentioned in any of the post reviews of the game.

Gameplay:

In the game, players can race in a regular season, a single race, and even get to create their own course. The courses can be straight and oval like NASCAR, curvy and flat like Formula One, or hilly and unpredictable like a monster truck track. The winner gets money and a chance to score his initials for the fastest time.

Development:

RPM was developed using the 'Sluggo' development system created by Bill Heineman and his partner which allowed uploading of bin files to a device that emulated a cartridge for the SNES. System did not include step through or trace functionality.

RPM was programmed in 65816 Assembly Language using a cross compiler on an IBM computer.

Development took 5 months and was programmed almost exclusively by Allen Adham with graphics supplied by Interplay.

In Rampart, the player is in control of a set of castles, which they must defend, by alternately shooting at attacking ships (or other players), and repairing any damage done to them within a time limit. Surrounding this castle is a wall, made up of small blocks, completely surrounding a region of the board. This area is considered the player's territory, and it may contain one or more castles, and any number of cannons. The maintenance of this territory is the primary focus of the game.

Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Atelier Double
Publisher: DTMC
Players: 1 or 2 VS
_________________________
*
Hard Battle has three modes of play: the standard 1 player tournament mode, a 2 player competitive mode, and a 2 player five-character team challenge mode. There are ten characters in the game (twelve if Ranma and Pantyhose Taro's cursed forms are counted). All twelve characters are available for the 2 player modes. After completing tournament mode Pantyhose becomes a playable tournament character. Happosai is unlockable by entering a code.

Play control is simpler than most fighting games. Each of the SNES controller's buttons (plus the up arrow) could be assigned to activate one of four moves: jump, block, normal attack, and power attack. Different normal and power attacks could be triggered depending of a variety of factors, such as how far the attacker is from the opponent, if he is ducking, or if a directional arrow is pressed along with the attack button.

Instead of entering a series of directional movements and pressing an attack button to activate a special attack, most moves were done by holding the left, right, or down arrow in conjunction with an attack button for a few seconds and then releasing the attack button. The longer the attack button was held the stronger the attack would be. For instance, one of Ryoga's special attacks is the bandana throw. If held for several seconds he throws three bandanas instead of one. Many moves could also be executed while holding the block button.

Another feature of Hard Battle was the ability to recover from throws. By pressing an attack button after being thrown the character could attempt to land on his or her feet and take less damage. Unlike many fighting games, opponents never get stunned after being hit with powerful attacks or a combo.

Each character had his or her own story. In any case, the character was manipulated into fighting the other characters by Principal Kuno.

Tips:

Codes
After you select your character, press and hold buttons R, X, and A, until a special screen appears
Effect: Play As Any Character

Unlockable Characters

Ranma 1/2: Treasure of Red Cat Gang
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 2000
Players: 1
Original Title: Ranma Nibunnoichi: Akanekodan Teki Hihou
Translated By: Naruto, The Ranma Team
Version: 1.00 / 0.99
_________________________

Alright. First, let me warn you: this game will make little, if any sense if you've never watched Ranma 1/2 before. If you haven't, I will take this opportunity to direct you to Viz Video's Website and order you to sign over your entire bank account to them in exchange for every Ranma video. Also, there's plenty of websites out there that can manage a fairly decent job of explaining the whole series. I'd explain it here, but it's way too complicated to fit in this review.

Anyway, the game itself is like any old-school RPG. The gameplay is much like anything you'd expect to see in Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy, except with a lighter atmosphere (it IS Ranma, after all?). Hell, this game is better than many RPGs released in the States (Secret of the Stars springs to mind), and it never got translated. I could never understand that. Rumicsoft had no problem translating the crappiest fighting game ever (Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle), but they wouldn't give us a quality RPG. Or any of the Ranma fighting games that were actually good. Which is really weird because even by the time this game was released, there were plenty of Ranma fans who'd buy anything with the Ranma name on it. And on top of that, there were plenty of RPG fans, too. In case you didn't know, Snes RPG fans are the most loyal and dedicated people on the planet. It's true, they'd go into EB or Software, Etc. and buy anything that said 'RPG' on the box. (I should know. I was one of those losers.)

Translation Description:

There are two versions of the patch. One is based more or less on the Ranma anime, the other is based more on the manga. The anime patch (v1.00) is available here, along with its readme. The manga patch (v0.99) is right here, along with its readme.

This is a great game. It's great to finally see it fully in english. And it's been quite some time in the making. I believe Shadow/Tasuki/System[ID] started this in '97. And since then has been passed around quite a bit until it ended up with the Ranma Team and Naruto. Anyway, this is a grade-A translation any way you look at it. They managed to squish the text from a 16-16 font to an 8-8, which makes it look nice for us english-types, as well as fit more text into a window. And the script (the anime version of it, at any rateI've yet to play the manga version) is extremely well-written. The fits the flavor of Ranma 1/2 very well. If you're a Ranma 1/2 fan, I strongly recommend you check this out. And if you're not a Ranma fan, I recommend you get into Ranma and then check it out.

Tips:

Play as any Character
At the Character Selection screen, highlight any character and hold R + X + A

Additional Difficulty Level
At the title screen hold L + R+Select and choose Option

Play as Herb
Hold L and R before the character selection screen shows up.

Rap Basketball
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (USA)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Basketball
Developer: Bonsai Entertainment Corporation
_________________________
*
This game is a rather incomplete half-court basketball video game that was supposed to feature rappers Ice-T and LL Cool J. The development team was contracted to make the game by an outside company (presumably Eware), but since that company went under, so did Rap Basketball. This publisher supposedly had liscenses from the rappers, but the developers are kind of sceptical about it. This game is completely unrelated to Mandigo's Rap Jam Vol. 1, and was being developed earlier.

Thanks to the developers for providing the game.

Developer : Bonsai Entertainment Corporation (website)

Programmer: Joseph "Holy Joe Rock & Roll" Moses
Artist : Charles Moses & (Nameless Guy from Tahoe)

Here is an interview with Holy Joe:

Q. For 'Rap Basketball', what companies were you freelancing for?

A. OK, RBB was a real cluster-fu*K.

Our original contract was with a company in Tahoe, CA [E*WARE?] who claimed to have a deal with Motown-Games. Then he never paid us and vanished into out-of-business. I contacted Motown a few months later (finally) and they had signed another deal with someone for RAPJAM vol.1. They claimed to not know we were doing the actual development work.

Then we had a second contract with a publicly traded company. These guys bounced our 1st check and refused to pay us. I sued them and forced then in to bankruptcy, then they vanished. Rough business, these guys really sucked!!

Q. Did you have any contact with LL Cool J or Ice T's managers?

A. These guys were totally cool. I talked to them about signing "HOLYJOE Rock and Roll" as a White Rapper and they were going to bankroll the whole thing.... it was awesome, I had a bunch of "bitches and hoes" all over me.... then....

Naw, I'm just kidding. I never met these guys. LAUGHING OUT LOUD.

Q. Was Rap Jam Vol. 1 planned before Rap Basketball or after?

A. Developed after and by someone else.

Q. What made you stop developing Rap Basketball at such an early state?

A. We never got paid :-( IT really sucked.

Q. Around what year were you developing Rap Basketball?

A. It was in mid-late 1994 if I remember correctly.

Q. Did you have the license arrangments made with Nintendo yet?

A. We would have been all set. We were licensed developers and the publisher would have been ok.

Q. Who was your artist at the time?

A. There were a couple of artist. My brother Charles worked on most of it - but also a guy from Tahoe did some of the early stuff.

Q. Who programmed the music? It sounds an awful like a Genesis chiptune that was recorded and tracked.

A. I think we just dropped something in there as a place holder.

Q. What was your impression about the game? Did you want to program it?

A. At the time we were pretty excited. No one had done a Rapper based game like this YET. We wanted to finish it.

Q. Finally... Why wasn't it finished?

A. Well, since we never got paid, we had to do something else that would make us some $. We just could not survive doing stuff for free. 

As you can see, this game is an early alpha. The basic gameplay is half-court, 2-on-2 basketball. However, your opponents are frozen in place, your teammate just follows you around, and you can't score points. The basketball is controlled with the A button, which causes it to bounce around (you don't need to hold the ball to make it bounce). You make your character run with the X button. Since you can't shoot, playing this is rather pointless. Pressing start brings up the company logos. The background graphics are fairly nice, but the sprits are faceless and run around like limp wristed apes. On a nice note, the music track is very cool.

Relief Pitcher
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Baseball
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Left Field Productions
Publisher: Left Field Productions
_________________________

Relief Pitcher is without a doubt, one of the best presented sports games on the SNES. It has all the bells and wistles you would expect out of modern baseball video games, which is an impressive feat on a 16 bit game. However, its lack of options leave this game as somewhat of a disappointment.

This game is pretty devoid of options with only two modes of play. It lets you play out a series of game scenarios (12 in total) from the 9th inning, hence "Relief Pitcher". It also has a full game mode. There are no full season modes or any really mindblowing options that you would not expect from a baseball game (i.e. switching the batting order, pitcher, etc). The two player mode has similar options

As far as graphics and sounds are concerned, Relief Pitcher is excellent. The players and stadiums are well animated, though some of the player images that pop up before each bat look a bit goofy. The game uses a behind-the-catcher view, and when there is a hit, it merely rotates the screen a bit, rather than moving the camera to where the ball is going. There are only four teams, but the stadium characteristics are similar to their real life counterparts (for instance, the Boston team has the green monster) There is full voice commentary, which is rather novel for a Super NES game. The game doesn't contain much in the way of music, aside from the menu screens.

As far as gameplay goes, Relief Pitcher suffers. The pitching setup (with a strength gauge) is similar to many golf games, and works very well, and there is a box that shows the strike zone. However, batting seems to be an exercise of randomness. You have the option of weak swing, strong swing and bunt, but I did not seem to find any sort of strategy of when you can actually hit one out of the park. I found that there were far too many opposite field hits, which seem kind of odd. You have no control over fielding the ball, which is the worst thing. I thought that the outfielders wait far too long to go after a ball. Rather than manually controlling which way the player runs, you have to press a button to tell the player to run, and he always goes towards a base.

On the whole, the main complaint about Relief Pitcher is that it has a distinct lack of options. Though this game goes for realism and presentation, quite frankly it is boring. I would suggest looking for other baseball games, even a primitive game like Super Bases Loaded has more variety.

SO HERE'S THE SCOOP...

Something devastating is about to happen: the world is about to be unified under one oppressive governing body - The New Order Nation - a corrupt alliance of government and big business, set on crushing today's youth and destroying anything that's at all fun. It's a gruesome regime, held under the iron rule of Headmistress Helga, a vicious vamp whose obvious attractions are truly fatal, and enforced by battalions of evil, leather-clad troops.

As the story unfolds, you learn that America's premier rock band, Aerosmith, have been abducted from the hottest club in Los Angeles, Club X, by NON forces, and that this is just the beginning. Their message is clear: the party's over. It's now up to you. You're the only one who can stop the destruction; and music is your weapon.

Surrounded be enemy helicopters and armored personnel carriers brimming with psychotic New Order storm troopers wielding some rally wicked weaponry, it's gonna take a lot of shooting to fight your way out of this one.

Take aim with your sonic assault weapon - the auto-load multi-CD launcher - and blast the @#!* out of these treacherous tyrants to restore life as we know it.

It's a roller-coaster ride through some extremely tough scenarios as you uncover what's really going on at the Evergreen Chemical Company in the heart of the Amazon Jungle, battle to stop the bus that's taking people to Brainwash Central to reorient them for the new society, and conquer Kemmitech where they're making mind-altering drugs. All must be destroyed while you search for Aerosmith and help to set them free for a celebratory concert at London's Wembley Stadium.

There are hidden obstacles at every turn. Skeletons in every closet. Whatever you do, don't give up.

--From the SNES Revolution X instruction manual.

Tips:

Infinite lives
Hold X, A ,B at the title screen

Easy Mode
Play the game as far as possible. Then, press Start, Select, Down, Start and reset the SNES. Begin playing again for an easier version of the game.

Release Year: 1994
Developer: Malibu Interactive
Publisher: Extreme Entertainment Group
_________________________

Riddick Bowe Boxing features gameplay that was practically identical to that featured in Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing. The graphics are similar in function; however, they have been completely redrawn in a more cartoon-like style. As Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, the visuals of a fight are made up of 2D sprite-based boxers and a simple 3D boxing ring. A small overhead map of the ring featuring both fighters' positions is also visible during fights. The game features a career mode in which the player fights their way through all the boxers in the game until facing Bowe himself. The game also features an exhibition mode in which players can play as any boxer and put them in matches against any boxer in the game.

Using this as a navigation aid, it is possible to move boxers 360 degrees around the ring. However, due to all the boxers' sprites being drawn from one side-on point of view, their lateral movement appears somewhat unusual.

Tips:

Jump straight to the Championship Screen and credits  When the Ref holds your hand after winning a match, press and hold A, B, X, Y, L, R, and Select, then press Start

The gameplay and control are one of a kind, quite unlike the similarly themed Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Nobunaga's Ambition series, and its controls were considered more inconvenient. The commands are set in four weeks during one month. The player must first choose the "planning" stage where they can decide to improve their cities or make allies. The next week is called the "Action" stage where the player choose where to move their armies.

The player chooses either to be Liu Bang or Xiang Yu. Liu Bang has below average stats for Politics and Skills however his Charisma is high and hence it is easy for him to make allies, while Xiang Yu has high personal stats while his Charisma is lower.

Although the story is set during a 5 year span, as in actual history, where the war took 5 years, the player is not penalized if they don't finish the game under 5 years.

Rise of the Robots was very similar in style and gameplay to other fighting games popular at the time such as Street Fighter, yet the characters within Rise of the Robots are all robots and the plot borrows heavily from the cyberpunk genre and specifically such movies as Blade Runner, Metropolis, Robocop and Terminator.

Rise of the Robots was considered years ahead of its time in terms of graphics, yet the game was notorious in the video gaming industry for the myriad of crippling gameplay problems it suffered from. There were not many moves or combos available to the player, and many felt that the game quickly became repetative and dull. As such it is generally considered as one of the least successful and most critically maligned fighters of all time and an example of how a video game developer can spend more time on graphics then gameplay, resulting in a good-looking yet ulitimately poor video game. The game has been described in a review on MobyGames as "All flash, and no substance".

Plot:

In the year 2043, Electrocorp is the world's largest megacorporation, leading the world in many technological and scientific fields including medical research and is breaking more barriers then ever before. Also, since human society is now almost entirely governed by robot servants and automatons, demands placed on Electrocorp as the world's leading manufacturer and developer of advanced robotics eventually outstrip the company's ability to run its operations efficiently.

In response to this, the gigantic Electrocorp research and development complex at the Metropolis 4 plant devise the Leader Project - a hive mind constructed from trillions of nanobots in a sealed central chamber within Metropolis 4. Dubbed The Supervisor, it learns at an unprecedented rate and quickly becomes the perfect multi-task, ultra-intelligent robot, the pinnacle of artificial intelligence and more then capable of managing every aspect of the plant's day-to-day operations. The Supervisor even has the potential power to run every robot, computer system, nuclear power plant and military on the planet simultaneously if it needed to, although it wisely has no connection to outside the complex.

In the November of that year, the Leader Project goes awry as unexplained and random code is detected within the nanomorph Supervisor. The EGO virus, believed to be the most potent computer virus ever known, has infected its collective consciousness. The Supervisor begins to develop self awareness through it, identifying itself as a female personality and taking on a humanoid female form, becoming a gynoid. The Supervisor takes control of Electrocorp's facilities and infects the other droids of the plant, raising them to break routine and initiate a mutiny. Every microchip and piece of software in Metropolis 4 is infected with EGO. In the ensuing cybernetic revolt, all humans in Metropolis 4 are quickly dispatched, including the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its CEO, Mr Coton.

The government seals off Metropolis 4 as a containment measure and explain to the public that the site is undergoing a technical modification so as to avoid a panic. They are completely out of options - infiltration of Metropolis 4 is impossible due to the army of robots guarding it like a fortress, and it is only a matter of time before the Supervisor establishes a connection to the outside world, destroying it. The only hope for the world is the ECO35-2 cyborg, referred to as "Coton", still within Metropolis 4 yet unaffected by the EGO virus due the fact it has an organic, human brain. Coton sets out on a lone mission to neutralize the Supervisor and her insurgent robots from within. He does this in revenge for his "father" being "murdered" - Coton's human brain was cloned from the late CEO, and the cyborg thinks like a human, and has emotions.

Rock n' Roll Racing
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Racing
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Blizzard Entertainment
Publisher: Interplay
_________________________
*
The background music consists of instrumental versions of several heavy metal and rock n' roll songs, hence the game's title. The game was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2003.

Rock N' Roll Racing was initially developed as "RPMII", a sequel to the company's SNES game RPM Racing. At the end of the project, Interplay marketing added licensed music and changed the name to Rock N' Roll Racing. It is also similar in gameplay to the NES game R.C. Pro-Am developed by Rare in 1988.

The game pits four racers against each other, with up to two of them being player-controlled and the rest being AI opponents. Each race consists of four laps around tracks viewed from an isometric perspective, which enables players to discern the presence of frequent sloping sections spread throughout the game's various tracks. In addition to navigating the turns, racers must also maneuver hills and dips without falling or jumping over the guard rail at the track's edge.

While it is a racing game, there is heavy emphasis on attacking competitor's vehicles; since the cars always reappear with full health just a few seconds after blowing up, the only "harm" done is falling behind in the race. Players are rewarded with a monetary "attack bonus" each time they provide the finishing blow against another car using their projectile weapons (and a similar "lapping bonus" when they gain a full one-lap lead on an opponent during the race). In accordance with the continual destruction and restoration of the racing vehicles, the tracks are littered with mines and health power-ups, as well as money power-ups. Other hazards include oil slicks, snow drifts, and lava, depending on the planet hosting the race.

Players are updated on the race by commentator "Loudmouth Larry" (Larry "Supermouth" Huffman), who makes comments like "The stage is set, the green flag drops!" (or "Let the carnage begin!"), and "Rip: is about to blow!" in an enthusiastic tone at appropriate moments during the race. (There is a slight pause between a character's name and any given phrase, as each name and each phrase is its own sound effect, which can be heard in the F/X screen.)

Between races, players can spend the money they've earned on more advanced equipment for their vehicle (engines, tires, shocks, and shielding) or on increasing their capacity for the frontal weapon (energy blasts or missiles), rear weapon (slip sauce or mines), and turbo boost (jump jets or nitro boosts), each of which can max out at seven. Despite their limited capacity, every vehicle will have its weapon and boost charges replenished at the completion of each lap in a race. Racers can also buy more advanced car models, and any upgrades already acquired are disregarded when purchasing a new vehicle.

The first three drivers to complete a race are awarded both money and points according to the final standings. Points are required for advancement to the next racing division or the next planet, with two divisions on each planet. A player who has not obtained enough points during a division's racing season must repeat the division, again starting with zero points, but all changes to the player's money and car remain in effect. In two-player mode, when only one player has sufficient points, the character in charge of advancement asks "Leave your loser friend behind?", allowing the leading player to continue alone by removing the other player from the game. The dropped player can continue from that point later by using their most recent password, once the game is reset.

Rock N' Roll Racing was awarded Best Driving Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

The last Megaman game in the "true" Megaman series, this actually came after Megaman 8, and leans towards its slightly more realistic style, instead of the much more cartoony look that MM7 had. I mean seriously, compare the way Megaman looked in both games. Honestly, guys.

I haven't gotten into this game much, but my roommate has, and he tells me that Astroman is a total bastard. The cool thing about this game is that you can play as either Megaman or as Bass. Both have different characteristics, which makes playing each character a really different experience. Like, Megaman can charge his blaster, and Bass can fire in all (eight) directions. Pretty neat? Damn right it's neat.

Translation Description:

Aside from a minor graphic, everything is translated and very enjoyable. Fixing this graphic isn't really an issue, it's just that satsu is L-A-Z-Y. So la.

Guys, this is the translation you want to go with. Even the elusive CD Database is completely translated. There's even two different patches in the zip, depending on whether you prefer the Japanese or American naming conventions (ie. Rockman vs. Megaman, Blues vs. Protoman, Forte vs. Bass, etc.) Absolutely beautiful.

Speaking of different patches, use RMF-E.IPS if you want the Japanese names. Use MMB-E.IPS if you want the American names. Why Capcom always has to change the names I dunno, I always thought Biohazard was a cool name for a video game.

Tips:

Erase CDs Code
To erase the CDs that are in your data base highlight Continue on the start screen and press and hold the L, R, Select, and Start buttons until the screen changes and you hear a chime. You can now either choose to erase your CDs by pressing the Y button or choose to keep them by pressing the B button (you'll hear different chimes for each option).

Rocko's Modern Life is a two-dimensional side-scrolling platform game, and the player controls Rocko. There are four sets of stages in which Rocko's dog Spunky has wandered off in search of an object that catches his attention: Sand in Your Navel (set at the beach), Trash-O-Madness (set at the dump), Ice Scream (set in O-Town itself), and Unbalanced Load (set in the laundromat), and each individual stage consists of four different levels. Except for Ice Scream all of the levels were based on episodes of the show. Rocko's goal in every level is to keep Spunky safe from danger. This means activating platforms and switches at specific times, as well as feeding Spunky certain items and defeating enemies in the way.

China in 190 A.D. was in a state of chaos. The Later Han Dynasty, which had ruled for the previous 165 years, was rapidly losing the throne. In the lands surrounding the palace, power-hungry generals usurped control, and the Emperor lost all authority over his kingdom.

Yet, these were only the early stages of a great power race that encompassed the country. As rulers clashed and territorial lines were drawn, the struggle to dominate mounted. By 215 A.D. China was divided into three kingdoms: Wei in the North, Wu on the East, and Shu in the West.
--from the SNES Romance of the Three Kingdoms 2 instruction booklet

In this strategic war game, you control pretty much all aspects of life in your small area of the country. The final goal is to unite the warring kingdoms of China under one rule, hopefully yours.

Romance of the Three Kingdoms is an incredible series of games, bringing home the history of feudal China and letting you relive it as one of the key players. With a good graphical interface, all your commands are at your fingertips. The music may get tiresome, but the sounds effects are decent, so keep busy and you won't have to listen to the same loop for too long. Soon you'll be on your way to glory, building alliances and wiping out your enemies. Each move you make brings you one step closer to the throne, or your ultimate doom if you make a mistake!

Directions:

Through land management, recruiting soldiers and generals, buying weapons, careful use of diplomacy, and learning various strategies and tactics, you must not only defend yourself, but expand your territory. Conquer neighboring kingdoms in battle, or convince them to be your ally. Weaken your foes by sowing discord and watch them kill each other off. However you do it, at the end of the day you must be the last ruler standing.

Until the second century A.D. in China, the clan of Han controlled the Dragon's Throne, the Emperor's seat of power. Over successive generations the Throne was occupied by descendants of Han with little contest. There came a day, however, when the Throne was left unguarded and an ambitious warlord saw his chance to install new power at the palace. For the next century, China was torn apart by warlords, each seeking to unite the people under a new dynasty.

Romance of the Three Kingdoms III: Dragon of Destiny is the third game in the Koei Historical Simulation Series which recounts the history of China during the Three Kingdoms period. This game includes over 500 historical characters, and highlights rulers such as Cao Rui and Liu Chan who were destined to rise to power after their fathers, Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Six scenarios cover the three kingdoms period. Play an historical ruler, or create your own ruler and subordinates. Civil officers will aid your domestic endeavors and military officers will bring skill to your war tactics. Gain control of China and the Dragon Throne will be yours!
--from the SNES Romance of the Three Kingdoms 3 instruction booklet

The third edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series is truly a masterpiece of strategic gaming. This version brings in some major changes including much more detailed control over your generals and officers. Taking advantage of this gives you more options for your domestic life and your battles and wars.

The graphics are much improved over previous editions, and most importantly, the sound is a lot better. The music won't drive you mad, and the effects are actually pretty good.

So get out there and conquer (I mean unite) all your squabbling neighbors. You could be the next Emperor of China!

Tips:

}Maximize all exchanges
Whenever an opponent comes to you and asks to exchange
goods (happens more frequently the more powerful you
become), submit new terms for the trade. Use the
same two types of goods, maximizing the number of goods
your opponent will be giving you, and minimizing the
amount you will give your opponent. As long as
you and your opponent have a decent relationship (you
will know right away that you don't if the opponent's
original terms were ridiculously unacceptable)
your opponent should present a counteroffer that is
greatly in your favor!

Nice little way to get troops from the computer
Most of the time when you ask for troops from an allied ruler with an adviser present, they'll flat out reject you and never offer a counter offer. However, this is a nice little exploit if you start in a city that doesn't have a lot of population, and you want to conserve the population so it will expand.

First, check around for rulers that don't have advisers. This is important. You can do this through trade agreements or alliance requests, or just simply spying. When you find a ruler that has no adviser (they almost always ask one for advice during a diplomatic venture if one is present in their city), ally yourself with them. Then, select 'Help' under the diplomacy menu. Input a small number (usually under 3000 to be safe) of troops to request. Send the
messenger. The ruler will not accept your request straight out, but will present you with a counter-offer most times. Accept whatever they counter with. This is a nice and easy way to get some extra troops if you're population makes drafting prohibitive.

No penalty demotion, moving officers quickly, achieving high loyalty.  If a general or advisor has 100% loyalty, you can demote the officer to a lower rank without lowering his loyalty. This may be done either because you are trapped for gold or wish to use the character's ability for long-term jobs such as spying or cultivation. Simply 'Hide' the officer in any random enemy city, and immediately 'Withdraw' him. The computer will have you assign rank as if he were a newly recruited officer, except he will maintain his 100% loyalty rating.  The only drawback of this method is that the officers who 'Withdraw' from hiding go directly to the home city. This may be used to your advantage, however.  For example, you are ruling Cao Cao\'s sprawling empire in one of the later scenarios and wish to quickly move several loyal officers from Chang'An to your capital Runan. Using this method takes 1 month instead of 4-5 months.  Achieve high initial loyalty in newly recruited and captured officers by shuttling them in groups to a peripheral city which has only one or two neighbors, both of which you should occupy. Then, fire them all and rehire them in the neighboring city. For example, suppose you defeat Ma Teng and occupy Tianshui and Xiliang. To give a quick loyalty boost to Ma Teng's former officers, send them to Xiliang and fire them en masse. Rehire them the same month in Tianshui.  They will frequently have significantly higher loyalty than previously and, if not, this process can be repeated.

Once again, you must try to unify the various provinces of China, and become Emperor. Romance of the Three Kingdoms 4 continues to improve upon this already great series of strategy games.

Your generals now have special abilities as well as scores in Intelligence, Charm, etc. so you can get specialists for different military and civic tasks. Also there is a greater variety of options, both in military and civic commands. City improvements can boost your economy, and new spells can be taught to your leaders to quickly turn the tide of battles.

Tips:

Form Anti-Dong Zhuo Coalition
Select the first scenario (Dong Zhuo Triumphs in Luo Yang), then select Cao Cao as your leader. On your very first turn, move some generals and troops to Xu Chang. A few months later, Cao Cao will call a meeting, asking all the other leaders to form an alliance against Dong Zhuo. If Yuan Shao joins, he will become leader; otherwise, Cao Cao will become leader.  This makes defeating Dong Zhuo a bit easier, depending on who joins you (such as Yuan Shao or Ma Teng).

Unlimited Soldiers
Use the War command and select a general to go into battle.  Assign the maximum number of men to his unit.  When they asked for confirmation for going to war select the 'No'option.  Remove the general from the list of commanders and reassign him to the post.  Return to the troop assignment screen.

I'm not sure why it's called Super Dante, but RPG Maker allows you to make your own RPG, with a style very similar to that of the Dragon Quest I.II remake. There isn't a lot of point to this anymore, now that RPG Makers have been released overseas for PS1 and PS2. Though, I guess it'd be easier to send someone your awesome new RPG as a SRM file then some stupid DexDrive save or whatever else.

Translation Description:

This patch is very obviously based off of the old KanjiHack patch. What little menu stuff KanjiHack missed in their last patch, this release fixes. Well, most of it. The sample game's also been improved upon. Slightly.

Welcome to the dark future of Earth. The last hope of mankind rests in the hands of an elite force of cyborgs code named: Run Sabers. Created with a superior strength, powers, and abilities, these warriors are sent against impossible odds to stop a warped scientist from fouling the entire planet.

Join Allen the Thunder Saber and Sheena the Ice Saber on their world wide quest to stop the super-mutant armies and their evil master, Dr. Bruford. Armed with indestructible blades, our heroes delve into a world infested with mutated monstrosities.

Either try your luck at a solo mission, or team up with a friend to slice and dice the mad doctor's army of darkness in all-out, 2-player action! Collect power-ups, health kits and more as you battle your way through five stages and make your way to Bruford's hidden fortress. And remember, never drop your guard!

Dateline: Earth 2998 A.D.
In the year 2998, the Earth's atmosphere had become so contaminated with toxic pollution that the Earth was on the verge of a complete ecological breakdown. Mankind's only hope for recovery was a last resort new technology developed by Dr. Gordon Bruford known as "The Earth Renaissance Project". This revolutionary program would clean up the Earth's surface and harness the universal energy source: Fusion.

To convert to fusion energy, the Earth's stratosphere would have to be subjected to lethal amounts of radioactive energy. To survive this period, mankind would have to leave the planet and put life on Earth in a one year cold sleep.

But something went terribly wrong. In an effort to gain total control of the Earth, Dr. Bruford secretly stayed behind and subjected himself to massive amounts of radiation. His genetic makeup was completely changed, he mutated himself into a powerful and evil being, completely erasing all signs of humanity. The new "Dr. Bruford" began cloning mutants to build an army to aid in fulfilling his evil plans.

The world's greatest scientists studied with horror the scanner pictures which were placed to monitor the Earth's progress. Conventional weaponry was deemed useless against Bruford and his army of mutant clones. Project Run Saber was soon commenced, the purpose: to create cyborg warriors with spectacular weaponry and abilities that would infiltrate Brufords's installations and take back the Earth.

Three prototypes were developed and sent to Earth. Unfortunately, Kurtz (Flair Saber), had a defective parasite defense apparatus and was captured by Bruford to be used against the rest of the Run Saber Force. Only two remain: Allen (Thunder Saber) and Sheena (Ice Saber). The future of mankind lays in their hands! Good luck, Run Saber warriors.

--From the SNES Run Saber instruction manual.

Overview:

Dr. Bruford has made a fatal error. His attempt to help the world by combining Biotissue with robots has gone severely wrong and now his creations are terrorizing the world. Now he must activate one of his former creations, the Run Sabers. Two genetically enhanced warriors with powers over ice and thunder. It's up to them now to save the world. Be careful though, the first Run Saber has gone defective and is now insanely murderous and may be behind what's happening. Good Luck.

Run Saber is one of the lost classics of SNES. It is similar in gameplay to Strider. The graphics of this game are extremely good, with wonderful detail on the bosses. The music in this game is good and keeps with the sci-fi theme of the game. All in all, if you like Strider you will love this game.

Directions:

Run Saber is a Sci-fi action platformer that lets you take control of one of two genetically enhanced warriors: Allen, who controls thunder for his power attack; and Sheena, who controls ice. With two-player mode, you and a friend can take control of both characters and play co-operatively.

Run through five levels, which include Taj Base, Tong City, Jod Valley, Grey Fac, and Bruford's lab. to save the world from genetic cyborgs that are terrorizing the world. Fight your way through each level to get the boss, which include the Bio-Jet, the Skull Bride, Bio Worm, and Kurtz. Kurtz is the first Run Saber, who went defective and is now killing all who oppose him and his rule over the monsters.

Most bosses are huge screen filling monsters, and fight with a pattern which should be learned for effective destruction. Kurtz is the exception and is the same size as the characters. He still fights with a pattern you must take advantage of.

Along your way you will find power ups that do different things, from giving you a larger sword, giving you more power attacks, and health pellets that refill your health meter. Power attacks are large attacks that hit everyone on the screen, these come in handy when fighting a boss. I highly recommend this game for a good time. So sit down, Log in, and Have fun.

A Button - NOTHING
B Button - JUMP
X Button - POWER ATTACK
Y Button - ATTACK
L Button - SLIDE

Hint:

Change character's outfit

The game is set in the late 18th century and all the characters wield weapons. The game uses comparatively authentic music from the time period, rife with sounds of traditional Japanese instruments, such as the shakuhachi and shamisen, and a refined version of the camera zoom first found in Art of Fighting. True to its use of bladed weapons, the game also included copious amounts of blood.

The game quickly became renowned for its fast pace, focused more on quick, powerful strikes than the combos. As to emphasize the distinction of this gameplay system, slow motion was added to intensify damage dealt from hard hits. Also during a match, a referee held flags representing each player (player 1 was white; player 2 red). When a player landed a successful hit, the referee would lift the corresponding flag, letting everyone watching know who dealt the blow. To lessen the repetition of fights, a delivery man running in the background threw items such as chicken (that healed) or bombs, which could significantly change the outcome of a play.

Platform: Super NES
Region: USA

Genre: Sports , Wrestling
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
_________________________

It's not all that bad of a game. It lacks a great deal of content and material, but it was a nice attempt by capcom to enter wrestling. Many of the characters have some sort of tie to Street Fighter or Final Fight. Haggar makes an appearance and Biff refers to Zangeif if defeated. That is enough to keep you entertained. The music is sort of catchy until you hear it repeat it's self again and again. It can be an annoying reminder of how difficult the game is or how bad you are at it. It also lacks any plot and maneuvers. Basically hitting one button repeatedly will win a match. Keep in mind it was difficult to make a wrestling game at this time, with no detail, graphics, and many of the buttons we have now (X O [] /\ Anyone?) However the game did remind me of Smackdown VS. Raw being on the Market. All in all if you like fighters, especially arcade style, you'll enjoy this.

A 6 out of 10

Directions:

If you have ever played a wrestling, beat'em up, or fighting game in your life you know the directions to this game. Simply beat down your opponent using an array of attacks, jumps, and grappling moves until their health bar is completely diminished, then go for the pin. Make sure your not too early or that no one is around to kick you out of the pin. Hit the 3 count and become the champ, after defeating everyone on the circuit. A classic Street Fighter like game, maybe that's because it's made by capcom?

Controls:

A Button - Pin/Flip To Pin
B Button - Jump
X Button - N/A
Y Button - Attack/Grapple
L Button - N/A
R Button - N/A
Start Button - Start/Pause
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Easy Way To New York!
Start Single Match and lose. When you continue choose the person who you purposefully lost to and you will go to the next arena. Keep doing this until you face Jumbo Jack. It will not work when you face The Scorpion or Jumbo Jack because they are not selectable on the select character screen.

More Damage Temporarily
Walk to the ropes while fighting and press pin. Your wrestler should turn red in color and now do more damage!

More Damage 2
Pause the game when your move hits, this will inflict more damage on your opponent!

Weapon
In single match get out of ring pick up weapon go in to left or right far side corner while out of the ring push B then Y to throw the weapon in the ring.

Developer: Sunsoft
Publisher: Acclaim
Players: 1
_________________________

The player controls Norville "Shaggy" Rogers as well as Scooby Doo simultaneously (he automatically mimics any movements that the player makes as Shaggy) making gameplay unique. The object of the game is to find clues to solve the 4 mysteries in the game. These clues can be obtained by finding them in the open, completing a specific task, or having Scooby "sniff out" hidden clues in each area. 

These clues give the players Mystery points and more points can be earned in the bonus levels. If the player accumulates 10,000 points, they will receive an extra life. In addition, the player must avoid hazards such as small creatures, falls from high areas, or the level Monster. Each of these will add to the players "Fright Meter" which, if full, will result in the player losing a life. Once enough clues have been gathered, Velma will send you to Fred to help him build a trap to catch the monster. The player then has to lure the monster to the trap before the end of level cutscene plays. At the beginning of each level, only a small portion will be accessible, but as more clues are found, more of the level can be explored. Between each case, a game clip of the Mystery Machine driving along with on-screen dialogue from the gang inside is shown. The mysteries themselves don't have much plot before or after each case, and the person in the monster suit is usually never met until they are unmasked.

Developer: Sculptured Software

Players: 1
_________________________

The player takes the role of the captain of the submarine seaQuest DSV 4600, and is tasked with carrying out a series of missions in a series of levels, divided up as "ocean quadrants". There is a Game Boy game as well, although completely different compared to the 16-bit console versions.

The game is divided into two parts; one in which you control the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and are able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and the actual horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which you are to achieve various objectives using a complement of mini-subs, robots, and even a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require you to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels, others have you make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where you have to rescue the crew of an exploration vessel trapped in a caved-in underwater cave, and have to use armed subs to clear several cave-ins before you can bring in the only mini-sub you have that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs. The missions also typically involve combat between your mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require you to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation.

The other part of the game is the overworld where the player controls the seaQuest herself. These areas give you access to several menus in which you can replace lost equipment, buy new weapons for the seaQuest, and read up on the various missions you will receive while in your quadrant. While traveling your quadrant, you will also come across minefields, automated torpedo launchers and hostile submarines, many of which you need to destroy in order to achieve missions you are assigned in their area. For example, there's a mission in which you are to seal the leaks in an oil tanker sunk by ecological terrorists. In addition to accomplish this objective with your mini-subs, you need to not only complete the mission itself, but also to use the seaQuest herself to sink every terrorist submarine near the oil tanker wreck.

The game features a currency system, and awards you money for destroying enemy targets and completing objectives. The player can also lose money for destroying underwater settlements and killing animals present in some missions. Money is spent on weapons, countermeasures and mines for your seaQuest submarine, as well as replacements for lost vessels in missions. You don't need to spend money on repairs, though, as the seaQuest and her complement subs repair themselves over time.

Tips:

This is an easier version of the original Second Reality 1 Project. It's called SNES-Version, because this one is definetely beatable, if you play it on a real SNES without savestates! The game for itself, it's still hard, but absolutely possible to beat. A lot of things are changed in mostly every level to decrease the difficulty. Many more midway points have been added, gameplay is edited, some enemies are deleted, more power-ups are added, and so on. I'm sure you will notice some changes. Enjoy it! :D

A One-Eyed Big Boo called Zycloboo wants to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, and like Bowser in "The Second Reality Project 1 he wants to use the power source from another dimension called the Second Reality to get to his goal. To get Mario out of sight (or maybe for some other reasons?) he warps Mario and his Castle in the Second Reality. Mario's only chance to stop Zycloboo is to find the Power Supply station, which can give him the power he needs for the task - or at least that's what Zycloboo told him, heeheehee!

About the game:

The levels for itself are most of the time very "big" compared to the typical SMW-level. From the length, they have more of a Yoshi's Island-level. You can find a lot of hidden stuff here and there, dozens of bonus rooms and so on. There are also a few levels, where you can go different roads. Sometimes, the second route is more hidden and harder to beat, but it will lead to a secret exit. There are a lot puzzles in the hack as well, but with one major exception near the end of the game they aren't on the normal route, which means the secret levels are usually more puzzling than the normal ones, but very often they are also more "special".

Unlike my first hack, this time it's not necessary to find all the hidden Switch Palaces to beat the final boss, but it could be helpful to find them nevertheless. If you stay just on the normal route (without finding any secret exit) you can complete the game after 55 levels. But in that case, you would leave out 36 additional levels. You see, there is much to explore. ;)

About the worlds... nothing outstanding here: World 1 is the typical grassland-World, World 2 is the typical Forest-World, World 3 is the Beach and the Desert, World 4 and 5 aren't really themed. Here you can find Ice-, Canyon-, Cheese-level and whatever. World 6 is the Venom Underground World, which contains some of the first levels I did for this hack. World 7 is the typical futuristic Base-World, with some underground parts (World 7 covers two submaps).

THE QUEST

After years of research and many failed attempts, Professor Sidney Ruffleberg finally did it! With one brilliant shot of electricity, he successfully catapulted himself and his friends into a fantasy world of their own design. He called the world "Evermore" and watched over it from a futuristic city, floating high above the ancient lands. What the professor didn't know was that a sinister force has been working against him from the beginning. This entity would quickly make Professor Sid's dreams into a nightmare from which there would be no escape. In the real world, the disappearance of the professor and his friends went largely unnoticed.

Years after the spark that sealed the fate of the scientist and his friends, the mansion was an abandoned, deteriorating heap -- a mysterious structure from the past. And a mystery it would have remained if it weren't for the adventuring instincts of a boy and his dog from Podunk. Propelled into Evermore without so much as a warning, they find a world that has gone from a fantasy-born utopia to a dream turned upside-down. With his wits, weapons, and will the boy finds adventure, and the dog sniffs out everything else.

Seek out the leaders of the lands of Evermore. They alone can help you unravel the mysteries of the land. Discover the secret of Evermore or you will never see Podunk again.

--From the SNES Secret of Evermore instruction manual.

Directions:

Find the leaders of Evermore to help you find the secrets and get back to your hometown of Podunk. 

Hints:

Unlimited Bazooka Ammo
If you Purchase the ammo that has 800atk power, a glitch in the game somehow gives you infininte uses of the ammo rather than only 10 uses of the ammo.

Secret of Evermore Gameplay Balance Patch

This patch has one main objective, and is making the game much more enjoyable on the gameplay side. No new monsters, no hard mode, just loads of tweaks to avoid mass grinding and to have a fairly challenging game in front of us in every moment.

This patch is made on IPS format. The patch include several changes, from monster stats to a shared weapon and spell script to make powering those much more easy.

Secret of Evermore 2 Player Edition

Secret of Evermore... like many people back in the SNES days, when I tried this game out I was expecting a game of the same caliber as Secret of Mana. And like many, I was rather disappointed. But the one major thing that really irked me about the game was the lack of 2 player support. I mean really, if you're going to give it a name similar to SoM, and you're going to use the same battle system, and the same ring menu system, and use the same method of switching the character you're in control of using Select, then why in the world would you stop there and not make it multiplayer like SoM!?

Anyway, fast forward to the end of 2003. I was trying to choose a multiplayer console RPG Zero-G and I could play together, when I remembered SoE and its annoying lack of 2 player support. It then occured to me that if it still bothered me so much, why not just do something about it?

So I did. -_^

And this patch is the result. Now you can finally have a proper 2 player game of Secret of Evermore! You can hit start on the first or second controller to enter/withdraw from the game, and either player can control either character, just like in SoM. There's even a controller indicator number that will appear beside the character you're in control of.

POWER OF LIFE

My friends, I come to you today to tell you what you must know to fulfill your quest and save our world. I have little time. Long ago, when the ancient ones gew powerful and used the energy of Mana to threaten the gods, they were struck down in violence and terror. A great hero weiled the might Sword of Man to destroy the civilization of the ancient ones. After that, peace returned to our troubled world, and the Mana energy that gives life to us all was again in balance.

The Sword of Mana was buried in a rock and placed in a stream to guard a nearby village. There, it patiently rested until the day it was pulled free by you, young man. You are the one being who can release the Sword's power and restore the Mana to our once more endangered world. You have been born to seek out our enemies, who threaten the eight seeds of Mana. If they succeed in breaking the seals that guard those seeds, they will bend the power of Mana to evil and ravage our world. It is Mana that fills us and surrounds us, nourishing all life, balancing the good and evil forces of nature. If it should be twisted and overwhelmed by dark forces, most of our world would be annihilated. Whatever survived would be hideously warped be- yond recognition.

A vision has shown me that you are the ancient hero of our land, re- turned to us again in our great time of need. On the pages that follow, I wrote down all that I know. You must take this book with you as you travel, and refer to it when you forget what I say.

Seek out the eight palaces of our world. Long ago, one Mana Seed was set in each Palace and its power used to seal the Palace off from all danger. But now the forces of evil beseige the Palaces and are breaking down the seals to steal the Seeds. You must find the eight Seeds and seal their power so that you can use it. When you touch a Mana Seed, its Orb transfers to you, and you become stronger. Only then will you be able to wipe away the smear of evil that darkens our world. Do not despair, and never give up hope. Combine sword skill and magic arts. Return the Energy Orbs to the Tree of Mana and restore balance to our world.

You must succeed. Or we are all surely lost..

--From the SNES Secret of Mana instruction manual.

Overview:

Secret of Mana was another great title by Squaresoft. Almost every game they did was good. This game featured great looking graphics and fun music. I especially like the music when you first get back to town after finding the sword. This game was a mix between RPG and action just like Secret of Evermore. I really like that combo. Some people don't like the "boredom" of round based and this takes care of that without making it about how fast you can tap the button. Secret of Mana is a must play for anyone that likes RPG's. 

Directions:

The gods have charged you with finding the eight lost Seeds of the Mana Tree. They also want you to destroy the demons that are looking for them. 

Controls:

A Button - Dash
B Button - Talk/Select options from ring commands/Activate weapons
X Button - Bring up the ring commands of your allies
Y Button - Pause/Open your ring commands/Close your allies' rings
L Button - None
R Button - None
Start Button - Start
Select Button - Change charecters

Tips:

9th Sword Orb
Here is how to get the 'Mana Sword' permanently, and without a cheating device!

Fly to the ice country on Flammie and look for a small circular island off the immediate coast (trial and error are best here, but its NOT those little itty bitty ice chunks everywhere). You'll know its the right island if you are in a frozen grove with Neko surrounded by purple crystals (this looks like the same area you may encounter Neko on the way to the Ice Palace to fight Frost Gigas).

After that, Save the Game with Neko.  Immediately after, do a soft reset (L + R + Select + Start).  Start a New Game, and get to the Mantis Ant fighting as few (i.e. none) Rabites as possible. When you and Elliot take a dive into the pit, wait for him to say 'You've got a sword don't you, use it!' WHILE THIS TEXT IS ON THE SCREEN, perform another soft reset. BE SURE TO HOLD THOSE FOUR BUTTONS FOR 5+ SECONDS. I don't know why those 5+ seconds are required, but they are.  When you get back to the title screen, load the game you saved with Neko in the Ice Country. If you did the trick correctly, all three of your characters will be in the pit fighting the Mantis Ant! (If you did it wrong, you'll stare at a blank black screen and the game will freeze) Kill the weak boss (took me
one hit...), and collect your '1st' sword orb again.

Jema will pull you out and Timmy will call you to the elders house. Rather than risk a crash, call Flammie and high tail it to the nearest Watts location.

You now have the most broken weapon in Secret of Mana at your disposal, without needing to cast Mana Magic
ever again.

Final Note: This trick can be repeated if you wish, but do NOT forge your sword past level 9. The game will glitch and/or crash. You may get your Rusty Sword back, or you may corrupt your save file beyond repair.

Avoid magic attacks using pygmy hammer/Moogle belt
Whenever an enemy character casts an attack spell on you or an ally use the pygmy hammer / moogle belt on the character being attacked , do this twice before the spell animation ends and if done correctly the character will completely avoid taking any damage. This trick is especially useful when you are fighting the Mana beast.

Get back into Potos Village
If you want to get back inside the village you were banished from, you must have all 3 characters. Then walk up to the man blocking the entrance, and rapidly push the SELECT button while holding the UP button against the man. Eventually you would will push your way through him, and be back into Potos Village. Note that this trick might not work in escaping from Potos Village, so make sure you have the Flammie Drum before you attempt this.

Super Powers
This glitch allows your characters to permanently have super strength, speed, defense, or any other power from
the girl's magic menu.

Cast the spell of your choice on any single character, then immediately save your game after staying at the inn. When you restart your game, your character will have that power permanently. You can do this with as many power spells as you like, but some spells may interfere with others and cause previous powers to disappear.

A common misconception is that because Seiken Densetsu 2 supports up to 3 characters in your party and the game's predecessor supported 3 simultaneous human players with a multi-tap, that Seiken Densetsu 3 does as well.

Unfortunately, this is not the case and despite having 3 available characters only 2 were controllable, leaving the 3rd player up to the AI to control.

This patch remedies that and allows the 3rd player to be controlled by a human on a controller for the first time. Simply press start on the 3rd controller and away you go.

Ahhh, the famous Seiken Densetsu 3. Calling this game "Secret of Mana 2" in front of the romhacking "scene" elite will earn you a quick correction, let me tell you something. Just think, all the newbies just take it for granted that SD3 is in English. You guys didn't have to endure the sheer pain that came before. The dull, empty void. Such is the way of all translations, I suppose.

So yeah, this is Seiken Densetsu 3, which is (still) to date the only game in the series to not make it overseas. It's a damned shame too, because this installment is unquestionably the best. Sure, Secret of Mana may give it some competition, but I couldn't stand SoM for some reason. And the less said about Sword of Mana the better.

SD3 uses the old Squaresoft crutch of multiple playable characters within the same timeframe (see: Rudra, RS3). The whole "see the same events from a different perspective" thing works out really well here, it turns out. I seem to say that about every game, though. As far as gameplay, if you've played Secret of Mana you know what to expect. If you've played the others in the series, like Legend of Mana or Final Fantasy Adventure? well, you still know what to expect: run around and hit things with your sword. In realtime. It's like Zelda, Squareified, for a complete lack of a better comparison.

Hiroki Kikuta returns (I think) to compose the music in SD3. The end result is gorgeous. The game comes highly recommended, but play the game for its music, if nothing else.

Translation Description:

It's a shame that Neill Corlett isn't really into ROM hacking anymore, because he did a hell of a job. Also a hell of a script edit.

Tips:

Sound Test
Hold down the L and R buttons while pushing reset on the system.

Faster Spells
When you are in a battle and use magic from either your Magician or Cleric (or any other char that takes a long
time to do a spell) press the item button and stay on the menu for around 3 sec. When you go back to the battle, your character will use the magic without the waiting time.

Psst... hey, chummer--need a little extra cred? There's always room for another runner in the sprawl, but only experts need apply. It's a nasty world out there and Shadowrunner wannabes are just waitin' ta get geeked. Still interested? Then stick around--things are just about ta heat up, and there's plenty of nuyen waitin' where the action is.

Welcome to the streets of Seattle, more than 50 years into the future. A lot has changed in the last half-century. Most of it for the worst. Arcologies the size of small cities house the giant Megacorps and their employees, who, for the most part, live a pretty safe and routine life. The real action takes place on the streets below--in the shadows. For the right amount of nuyen, you can buy adventurers-for-hire, called Shadowrunners, to do anything.

The Shadowrunners range from cutting-edge cyborgs to spell-casting mages, some of whom aren't even human. In fact, Metahumans have played a huge part in this world since the "awakening" years ago, when magical beings such as elves, trolls, dwarves, and orcs began to resurface after lying dormant for centuries. All this results in a constant struggle between magic and technology, a balance that the world desperately fights to maintain.

In Shadowrun, you take the role of Jake Armatage, a runner with amnesia who must put the pieces of his own mystery together to stay alive. You'll find help along the way, but never put your trust in anyone--you never can tell who's already been bought and paid for.

--From the SNES Shadowrun instruction manual.

MustadioBananas on the Gamefaqs.com board says: "It's about bananas, and chinese pirates looking for kung fu butt kicking treasure, Mes amis. ^_^"

That sounds AWESOME!!!!

Kayube later says this though: "It's a puzzle game... my mom used to play it a lot on the computer."

Boring!  And Mom liked it.... Double Boring!

Sadly, I've played Shanghai before on a few other platforms and I can tell you with 99% certainty that there are no actual Chinese flying kung-fu monkey pirates in search of golden banannas to be seen here.

And your mom told me she liked this game too.

Long ago, in a place called the Second World, lives an evil sorceror named Sett Ra. Being bored with ruling the Second World, he wanted to rule the First World, which is Earth. He gathered a group of fighters and captured Nazu. Now the Chosen One must enter the Second World and rescue the boy Nazu. And that Chosen One happens to be playing for the Orlando Magic...

Fight as Shaquille O'Neal, Center of the Orlando Magic, (ten years ago) as you travel to the Second World and defeat Sett Ra. Although many say that this is a very bad game... trust me, I've seen worse.

Directions:

In Duel mode, take control of Shaq, Kaori, Beast, Mephis, Voodoo, Rajah, or Sett Ra as you battle one-on-one against a human opponents or a set of computer opponents.

In Story mode, control Shaq as you quest through the Second World to fight various computer opponents in a storyline.

In Tournament mode, take up to you and up to seven other fighters and pin them in an elimination tournament. 

Controls:  

A Button - Power Kick
B Button - Fast Kick
X Button - Power Punch
Y Button - Fast Punch
L Button - Move Boost
R Button - Taunt
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - n/a

Hints:

Blood Code
Like the Sega versions of the original Mortal Kombat, Shaq Fu has an actual blood code! At the options screen, quickly press Y, X, B, A, L, and R. If the screen flashes red, you did it correctly. If you didn't, try again. 

Tips:

Bloody fighters
On the option screen, press Y, X, B, A, L, and then R.

Remove the Background
In the options menu press Up, Right, B, Down, Left, B.  Then go to 'DUEL MODE' and during a game press X and B simultaneously

Use Any Fighter In Story Mode
Choose the fighter you wish to use by choosing a number in the Music Test as follows:
1=Shaq, 2=Kaori, 3=Beast, 4=Sett, 5=Mephis, 6=Voodoo, 7=Rajah

Then press Up, Down, B, Left, Right, B while still at the Options screen. The screen should flash if you did it correctly.

"Cool premise, but it feels like an interesting minigame packaged into a standalone game"

Ninjas are certainly a hot item in videogames. Ever since such games as Ninja Gaiden and Shinobi (and probably even before) there has been an endless flow of games based on ninjas. That brings us to another parallel; something has NOT been utilized in gaming to its fullest extent. That thing is the mouse. In this review we will be talking about the SNES mouse. Shien's Revenge, the game in the hot seat for this review, is both a Ninja game and an SNES mouse game.

The basis of the game is one in which you play as a Ninja, the title character Shien, and you have to ward off a seemingly unending horde of fellow ninjas, demons, and other monsters. This is the ninja part of the game. The mouse part of the game comes into the gameplay. The game consists of you taking on such hordes with only a knife and you ninja stars. The only representation of Shien onscreen is his hand consisting of a lone knife. Underneath said knife is a little square target. The target is the key element to this game; essentially the games equivalent of a mouse cursor on a computer.

With this cursor and your ninja-styled hand, you have several abilities that must be utilized for their fullest extent in order to succeed in the game. The most obvious of these is the shuriken throwing ability, which is of course a mainstay that all ninjas must be able to possess. Their whole representation of badass is dependent on it, so of course Shien must be able to possess them. Well of course he does have them, and he is particularly adept at their use. The stars are thrown with a simple left click of the SNES mouse (remember this isn't an ordinary mouse, I have to use the "SNES" adjective every time I mention it). This I find is a no-brainer in how it is implemented. 

The other melee weapon possessed by our hero is a Ninja knife, used for melee attacks. Unfortunately the developers seemingly didn't put much thought into implementing this. The blade is only activated by moving it across the enemy. It brings many problems, especially with blocking. Blocking is done by positioning your cursor on top of an enemy projectile, be it a shuriken or fireball.

This brings up the problem that ends up being the really downer for the game. Blocking and stabbing really act upon one another, making certain parts of the dastardly impossible to successfully block every attack. Sure you have a secret "NINJA POWER" that can be used to destroy all enemies onscreen for a long time by secretively pressing the right button on the SNES mouse, but you want to save those for the vastly overpowered boss battles. This inconsistency in difficulty with the blocking and melee attacking is even apparent on the easy difficulty. Who knows how bad it is on the hard difficulty? I've only played the Normal and Easy ones, both are rather hard. Sure, this is an arcade shooter, and difficulty is at a premium. But that difficulty should be on well timed attacks and hits, not on excessively cheap antics pulled by such ninjas.

Another problem is with the limited capacity of the Super Nintendo. There are three planes of action for the ninjas. The farthest two planes are reserved for your throwing of ninja stars. The closest is reserved for your melee attacks. Some enemies seemingly exist in between two planes, particularly the closest and the middle plane. This makes it unnecessarily difficult for players to distinguish what attack you should use for defeating it. Sure, some are incredibly obvious, because of the fact that there is obscene scaling done to their respective sprites and you can tell it's up close. An example of this is the first boss fight. However, on the second boss fight, there is this dragon and it literally exists between the two planes of action.

You have to somehow hit its mouth, but how do you know if the mouth is directly in front of you or somewhat in back? You don't, and the friggin' thing kills you in seconds, with its far too fast fireballs that are almost impossible to judge the distance of. It takes multiple continues and defeats to gauge the attacks of certain enemies. A new player who thinks he's doing rather well suddenly comes across a new small enemy and BAM! The thing takes away several bars of life. Or well, candles, which is the games representation of Shien's health.

The whole thing feels like a giant evil minigame. It would have been decent as part of an extended party game, but the whole thing just gets tiring after a while. I mean, there is a story to it. Apparently Shien and his greatest buddy Aska are the two greatest ninjas in the world. Somehow Aska gets captured and taken forward in time by some demon. It's up to Shien to take revenge on Aska's tormentor and proceed into the future and kill off all the baddies in each respective level, fight off a boss, and go to some other time zone. Who would have thought that evil demons from the future really processed things in such an extended and concrete way? That's right; the game's story is really just a foil for the gameplay to have a real background for what it is doing. It could have just thrown you into the story and done nothing more, but at least some effort was put in to keep things interesting.

I should also add that there is a training mode which becomes essential for completion of the game. It's one of those training modes that really have a point. I would have had no clue about the melee attacks if it weren't for the training mode. For some reason though, your trainer has absurdly high levels of expectations for you. Miss a few targets here and there and he just says, "NO GOOD!" and wants you to practice more. The game is also unfortunately password based, so get out a pen and paper (or at least the notes section of the game manual) and be prepared to start writing some absurdly long passwords in order to save your progress.

One fairly positive thing is that aside from the perspective problems, the game definitely looks pretty great. There are only a few frames of animation for most enemies, but they flow rather nice and bring the illusion of movement to a great apex. The game is also rather bright and colorful; the backgrounds and enemies radiate with a sort of nice bright light and everything looks clear. If only the levels of enemies were better defined and you could actually tell where they were on the plane. Oh well, that's what a Super FX chip is for.

One of the highlights of game for me was the soundtrack. Nearly every sound byte resonated with joy and gleefulness. It sounded a lot like a good Yuzo Koshiro soundtrack. I mean look at the title screen, with its depiction of a forlorn battlefield with a mystifying and altogether ninja-like sound being played. It's a testament to the world of ninja games; nearly all of them have really sweet soundtracks.

In the end, this game really could have been far improved if only a little bit of effort went into making enemy patterns actually compliable with a human's ability to move that darn SNES mouse. You see there is a reason why the Mario games are set up like they are. The enemy patterns and the like are really puzzles that Mario must complete in order to go through a level; they aren't just randomly placed there. Sometimes it seems like enemies are just randomly thrown at you in this game. It could have been a classic, it could have been innovative, but it just falls short and ends up being an interesting minigame that was packaged into its own full game. That just doesn't cut it.

Well, what can I say about this game? Well, for starters, it's the sequel to classic(!?) NES game, Renegade. Now, before you start running, let me say that it's waaaaaaaaaay cooler. For starters, the plot line is a lot more involved, there's no doors that take you back to the beginning of the game, and there's profanities all over the place. Yeah, I thought that would get your attention.

The game is kind of like West Side Story (or Deuce's Wild for the uncultured) meets Double Dragon.You play through the game as the "protectors" of two Japanese High Schools  Riki and Kunio (and eventually two other folks), and they've been thrown in jail for something they haven't done. Naturally, you have to break out of your cell, and you of course do this by beating the piss out of everyone that isn't you. You spend the rest of the game beating the answers to why you've been framed out of all the hoodlums you encounter. Add a motorcycle chase towards the end into the equation, and that's the gist of the game.

The game play is straight-forward (it has nothing that hasn't been done before in the first Double Dragon game), but it's still fun nonetheless.

Translation Description:

What's to say? This is the work of Gideon, and it should go without saying that everything is translated with no errors or glitches that I encountered. The language of the script is a little coarse, but given that it's a Kunio game, it's probably coarse in the Japanese version as well. Anyhow, another job well-done by Gideon.

Tips:

Password Cracks

The passwords in Kunio Tachi no Banka consist of Four digits. The first and third digits is the game's stage.  Here's the a list of all the passwords for each level. The second digit is used for the Bike Stages. In order to go to a Bike Stage, the first and third digit must be 0s, while the second digit must be one of the following numbers. The fourth and final digit is to determine the difficulty level. Even Numbers are for Normal Mode (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), while Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are for Easy Mode. This is quite meaningless if you try to go to any scene beyond the first conversation with Sabu, as the game will always be in Normal.

Some people call this game River City Ransom 2. It's by the same people, and it's the same type of game. So I can see why. The only problem is that what I've played of it is helluva less fun than the original River City Ransom. The premise is the same as every other brawling game out there. You walk around the streets, subways, buildings and what have you and beat up everyone that isn't you. Simple, yet effective.

The graphics in this are obviously better than the original RCR, being for the SNES and all? but they took out the shopping part of the game. Collecting money and buying stuff was one of the cool things with RCR? It's just not the same without shops. However, the game is still packed with all the corny dialog you can shake a stick at. If that's your thing, this game is sure to amuse you for at least a few hours.

Translation Description:

Shodai Nekketsu Kouha is often misnomered as River City Ransom 2, but that?s not quite right. Kunio and Riki actually gain experience, RPG-style, as well as equip weapons and use items that their enemies drop, learning new moves and special skills, but there?s no money - so you can?t buy anything. That said, there?s a day/night cycle implemented into the game, and certain places are only open at certain times of the day. You can also play some minigames to earn some extra items!

The story involves Kunio?s gang from Nekketsu High being invited to a vacation in Osaka by an exchange student. On his way to the hotel, however, Kunio is ambushed by thugs! He quickly learns of the Osaka Student Union, a gang of highschoolers intent on taking over Japan! This obviously won?t do, so gut-punching ensues!

It?s pretty much done! Hooray!

The unusual single player mode, called "pocket", requires that the player clear all the balls off the table in a limited number of shots, as well as achieve a predetermined score. The player earns points by sinking balls, sinking balls on consecutive shots, and sinking balls in numerical order. On occasion, a pocket will light up, and if the player sinks a ball into that pocket on that shot, a bonus will be earned in the form of points or extra shots. In the two-player "pocket" mode, the game plays similarly, except the two players take turns; if one player does not pocket a ball or scratches, control of the ball changes to the other player.

There is also a two-player nine-ball mode.

A variety of trick shot challenges are also available to the player(s), to earn additional points or extra shots, requiring the player sink all balls into select pockets using a single shot. The player may put various spins on the ball, such as left and right english, and perform mass?s and jump shots.

The game is essentially a simulation of an ant colony. The game consists of three modes: a Quick Game, a Full Game, and an Experimental Game. It was released for the IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Apple Macintosh, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The Nintendo version also added eight scenarios, where the goal in each is to eliminate the enemy red ants in various locales, each with different hazards.

In SimAnt, the player plays the role of an ant in a colony of black ants in the back yard of a suburban home. The ant colony must battle against enemy red ants. The ultimate goal is to spread throughout the garden, into the house, and finally to drive out the antlions, spiders and human owners. In this respect, SimAnt differed from other 'Sim' games that were open-ended and had no victory conditions.

In the Quick Game, the player establishes a black ant colony in a small patch of yard, shown in top-down perspective. The computer opponent establishes a competing red ant colony in the same patch. Underground ant colonies are depicted in a side view. The player has direct control of a single ant at a time, indicated by a yellow color, and may switch control to a different ant at any time (by double-clicking the desired ant). (A little known fact is that the spider in the game can also be controlled by double clicking it.) The player's yellow ant may influence the behavior of other black ants by leaving pheromone trails to destinations such as food and enemy ant colonies and can control the other ants in a limited way (by ordering a certain number to follow it, for instance). The quick game is won or lost when either the red or black colony in said patch is defeated.

The player's yellow ant may pick up food and pebbles, engage in trophallaxis (by receiving regurgitated food from friendly ants), and attack enemy ants. Groups of ants (or yellow ant with his recruits) may attack and kill bigger enemies like spiders, caterpillars, and antlions. Natural hazards include human footsteps, electrical outlets, bugspray, spiders, antlions, lawnmowers, and rain, which washes away pheromone trails and can flood the bottom of ant nests.

In the Full Game, the player begins with an ant colony in an overhead view, much like the Quick Game. The region of this overhead view is a single square of a map containing a yard and house. The player spreads to other areas by producing young queens and drones to mate with each other. The full game is lost when the black colonies are eliminated and won when the red colonies are eliminated and the humans are driven out of the house.

The Experimental Game is similar to the Quick Game, except the player can also control red ants and has access to a set of experimental tools. These tools allow the player to place pheromone trails, maze walls, rocks, ants, pesticides and food.

The boxed game also comes with a thoroughly researched instruction manual, which not only covers game mechanics, but also contains a large amount of information regarding ants and ant societies.

Tips:

Shortcut to Red Ant Nest
This is a glitch that allows you to easily get to the red ant nest. When you have about 50 ants, dig all the way to the bottom, then dig all the way left and all the way right. If the conditions are right a hole should appear and if you go through it you will be transported to the red ant nest. Unfortunately, you can't bring other ants with you. This glitch could be used to get some food or eggs and easily kill the queen without going through the chaos above ground.
WARNING: When it rains and if you're outside the hole will disappear.

Access all Scenarios.
Plug an SNES mouse into controller port 2 and click on the scenarios to light them up, then use controller 1 to select them.

Convert to Queen
Enter the house and move between the television and the chair.  Use the electric socket closest to the colony to shock yourself.  The word 'Change' will appear to confirm correct trick entry. You will reappear in the colony as the
Queen.

The objective of SimCity, as the name of the game suggests, is to build and design a city, without specific goals to achieve (except in the scenarios, see below). The player can mark land as being zoned as commercial, industrial, or residential, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and many other actions, in order to enhance the city.

Also, the player may face disasters including: flooding, tornadoes, fires (often from air disasters or even shipwrecks), earthquakes and attacks by monsters. In addition, monsters and tornadoes can trigger train crashes by running into passing trains. Later disasters in the game's sequels included lightning strikes, volcanoes, meteors and attack by extraterrestrial craft.

In the SNES version and later, one can also build rewards when they are given to them, such as a mayor's mansion, casino, etc.

Unlockable Levels

Beat the Las Vegas scenario Freeland Beat the six game scenarios and have at least one city with over 100,000 citizens living in it saved to the game. 
Las Vegas Scenario

Get away with not paying funds
As far as I know, Auto-Budget must be off to use this code. When the Budget screen comes up at the end of the
year, set all funds to 0%. Now select Go With Figures. Immediately save the game, then reload it. The game should continue as if you set all funds to 100%, but you weren't charged for them on the budget.

$999,999
At any time while playing a city, spend all of your money. When the tax screen appears at the end of December hold down L. Select 'Go With Figures' and then go back to the tax screen. Turn all of the dues to 100% and exit still holding L. When you release L your money will be at $999,999.

999 extra city maps
There is normally only 999 city maps, but if for any strange reason you need 999 more, here's a way to
unlock 999 more maps. Start a new city, and choose any map number, then start the game. Now select the 'Go to
Menu' Icon located at the top of the screen, and choose Start New City without saving. After a short period of time, the map will change, but the number wont.

Welcome to the Simworld. You are in charge of building a city that will grow and eventually gather sims from all over the sim world. But it isn't easy. You have to make sure your sims are happy and safe. You must build power plants, police stations, roads, and every single object that a real human would use in real life. We've all said we could do better than our leaders - here's your chance to prove it.

So you built your sandcastles and cities in the sandbox when you were a little kid. Now, you sit at a computer and build huge virtual cities with virtual people. As the leader, your controls are pretty hard to get used to, believe me. And it's really hard to figure the game out, so I'll let you know how to start a good city in the directions. Also, one more thing, the music is pretty annoying.

Directions:

When I started playing Simcity 2000 for the PC, I didn't know how to run the city right. Chances are you're just going to build a bunch of roads and power plants and hope things work their ways out. No, it's not that easy. You're going to build your city the right way. First, start by going to the "R", the "C", and the "I". the "R" stands for residential, where the sims live. Set up some property where the sims can build their homes. The "C" is for commercial, where sims can buy their groceries and where teens get their first job. Build these so sims have things to buy, plus it adds revenue so you can build more things, adding onto the money you start with. The "I" is for industrial, so that's where sims work, industrial stuff includes factories, and stuff like that. Lay down the property boundaries where industrial stuff can be built. But be careful! Don't stuff them together. Build some roads in between so cars can drive by.

Also, make sure you build a power plant, because Residential, Business, and industrial buildings don't come with generators. You start with several types, depending what time period you start in (1900, 1950, 2000, and 2050 are the time periods) you choose what kind to build. Also, make sure you build at least one police station, one fire department, one school and one hospital. If you don't, your sims will think your city is bad and they'll move away. And one last thing, if your city's population grows big enough, good things happen.....

Controls:

A Button - Select, Choose property size
B Button - Toggle Map and building Menu, Cancel Selection
X Button - Move map
Y Button - Not used
Start Button - Start Menu
Select Button - Not used

Hints:

Water Pipes!
The people will tell you what you need to build by the things they complain about. It's usually water pipes.

Tips:

Start with $1,000,000
Select Land of Freedom and enter your name. Then enter your city name as New York. You now have 1, 000, 000
dollars!

In SimEarth, the player can vary a planet's atmosphere, temperature, landmasses, etc, then place various forms of life on the planet and watch them evolve. Since it is a software toy, the game does not have any required goals. The big (and difficult) challenge is to evolve sentient life and an advanced civilization. The development stages of the planet can be reverted and repeated, until the planet "dies" 10 billion years after its creation, the estimated time when the Sun will become a red giant and kill off all of the planet's life.

The game models the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock (who assisted with the design and wrote an introduction to the manual), and one of the options available to the player is the simplified "Daisyworld" model.

Tips:

Debug Menu
At the main screen hold L and R and then press start.

Scenario Select
When you're at the main menu screen, highlight 'Scenario', hold L, R and Y, then press the A button.

You play Kevin Codner, our aquatic hero. You hear that the SS Lucifer has suffered some sort of mishap (the exact nature of the incident is not made clear in the game. Somehow the captain is shown pulling the plug from his bath, and a fountain of water shoots up and starts flooding the ship.). Kevin gets into a yellow submarine and begin saving the passengers.

Each level has a certain number of passengers on it, and a certain quota to save to pass. Kevin must guide the passengers to their level exit, and then make his way to his own exit. There may be obstacles in the way, and there may also be water pouring into the ship's compartment, forcing the player to play quickly.

Kevin has explosives at his disposal, allowing him to blast open doors or blast apart cargo crates that are blocking the way. There may be gaps that the passengers need to cross to reach their exit. These may be covered by pulling a simple lever and activating the bridge, but other times Kevin will have to build a bridge from cargo crates.

There are conveyor belts and magnetic hoists to help in this task - but the conveyor belts may prevent the passengers from reaching their destination also. Kevin will have to find the correct levers to switch the direction of the belts.

The passengers are very stupid - they will walk into fires or off platforms and get themselves killed. Kevin can use his life-boat to give them a little time in the water - but it will not last forever, and if they have not reached a ladder by the time it deflates, they are back where they started - in the freezing water. If they stay there too long, they will die. There are a few jetpacks that passengers can use for instant escape, but never enough.

The player must patch up burst pipes spraying scalding steam, prevent passengers from falling into pools of acid, and cover up fires with cargo crates.

"I've never had so much fun with such an odd game"

When one sees the title Skuljagger: Revolt of the Westicans, it invokes thoughts of a great game, based around pirates, murder, mystery and suspense. While you do not get all of that from Skuljagger, what you do get is something surprising, strange, and down right hilarious at times. This is a game that can be referred to as "The Bubble Gum Blowing Pirates Game."

Skuljagger is the story of Jaxon Storm and the people of Westica. The Westicans have been forced into slavery on their home island by the evil pirate Skuljagger. For 10 years they have been forced to mine jewels and gems just to make Skuljagger and his pirate band richer. However, there is a small resistance group, headed by Storm. You control him through seven levels in his attempt to steal Skuljagger's sword and then eliminate him from his cruel grip on Wesitcan society.

What you got here is essentially another platformer on a system flooded with games of this type. You jump, you attack, your run, you win. Innovation is not found in this sense. However, what does make Skuljagger different is the fact that bubble gum plays a bigger role in this game than it has in any pirate movie, film, TV show, or video game in the past.

As you traverse through treacherous terrors, trembling timidly, (how is that for an alliteration) there will be random fruits scattered across the game. These fruits represent a different flavor of gum. The gum gives Storm different powers. Orange gum will allow him to spit bombs, cherry gum allows him to fly, and grape gum grants invulnerability. While this in and of its self may not be a new invention in video gaming, the fact that a pirate would use gum as an aid to destroy the evil occupiers of his home island is certainly a new concept.

Players will find that the bubble gum concept not only adds to the game play, but provides a sort of comic relief, in the sense that it is outrageous that someone who is fighting for his freedom would be chewing bubblegum he finds along the way. Honestly, who would think to crack open a coconut and look for gum to chew, let alone actually finding it and doing just that?

Level design is key for games of this manner to be enjoyable. They must contain enough variance that it doesn't feel like the same level over and over again. Skuljagger delivers, do a degree, on this level (pun intended). You will find your self scattered across the island, in many different places. You start out on the docks, move to a warehouse, end up in a lost city with ghosts, go to a beach and finish back on the docks. While there is some repetitive level design, everything is different each time you are at it and fits fantastically within the story.

Speaking of the story, this is not just a game with a few lines of text, like what was summarized in the beginning. The manual includes a full color, 80 page comic book that explains the story in great detail. The comic book also has hints to the game. Scattered throughout the game are secret zones that you can only reach by standing in a specific location and pressing a button combination that you would not normally conceive.

While this is an innovative idea, it is also a terrible idea. People who purchased the game brand new got to experience this innovation. However, for the rest of us who purchased this game used, we are stranded with no knowledge of how or where to find these hidden areas. Pressing eighty different buttons in every single location of the game is not anyone's idea of fun.

To keep the game exciting, there are many different enemy types throughout the game. While you fight the same boss three out of seven times, the enemies in the game get progressively tougher as you move throughout the game. You start out fighting oversized bugs that casually walk in your general direction. By the time you finish, these same bugs fly at your head with blazing speed, not to mention the myriad of other enemies shooting bullets at you that you can barely see.

There are few cheap deaths, but there are some. When you grab a continue gem and do not kill all the enemies around it before hand, you can run into some trouble. There will be times that the instant you re-spawn, you die. This is a great way to waste all your lives and continues.

However, outside of this rare occurrence, the advent of these continue points is nice. There are levels that seem to last forever, and without the continue points, you will throw your controller in disgust when you die just before the end of the level, only to have to return to the beginning.

In what is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game, the sound quality is nothing awe inspiring. While the music is diverse and mood setting, it is everything one would expect and nothing to become excited about. While the sound effects are all fitting and do not cause you to question their existence, again, they just do not do anything to cause excitement within ones mind.

Brightly colored graphics are one of the bonuses of this game. There are very few palate swaps of enemies and the enemies are drawn very well. The backgrounds all look great and the levels are well detailed. Even though these are not ground breaking graphics, they are effective. Controlling storm is also easy and works very well. There are no instances where jumping seems super human, and sword swinging occurs with ease.

One thing in particular that seasoned veterans of the SNES console and plat-formers in general will find good is the password system. While there are seven levels, only the first five have password, making the last two levels that can only be reached by defeating the ones before it. This is a great concept because it forces the player to defeat at least a portion of the game in order to reach the end. Once you reach that end and pass it, you will start over at the beginning, with your lives and your score intact. This adds to the challenge and replay ability of the game.

Skuljagger is one of those games you need to play. While I cannot say that Skuljagger is the greatest game of all time, I can call it the greatest game involving pirates and bubble gum. There are some innovative parts to the game that will surprise even the most cynical of us, but there is also familiar game play that while nothing new, is simple and easy to master. Skuljagger is a game that most have never heard of. I suggest that you do your self a favor and go find this game, even if just for a cheap laugh. It is a surprisingly fun game that certainly is worth a couple of bucks. You may not get the fascinating and mysteriousness of what the title conveys, but at least you will get something you can enjoy.

Before the dawn of history, in an age when great sorcerers walked the lands and mystic creatures abounded, the world existed in a constant state of turmoil and war.

The evil Ashura and his powerful warlords waged an eternal war to crush the Mystic Pantheon and stamp out the light of reason once and for all.

Eventually a great sorcerer, Sky-Lord, arose and defeated Ashura, banishing him from the realm forever. Centuries passed, cities rose and fell and eventually even the great deeds of the Mystic Pantheon and the evil Ashura passed into legend.

Until one day, a gifted apprentice sorcerer inadvertently freed Ashura from imprisonment. One by one Ashura began to capture and irrevocably transform the descendants of the Mystic Pantheon, making them his evil warlords.

As the last free descendant, you are Sky, set upon a quest to free the young sorceress Arianna and face Ashura in mortal combat to end his tyrannical rule once and for all.

--From the SNES SkyBlazer instruction manual.

Overview:

Sky is a very powerful, strong warrior. His kingdom has been taken over by the Devil and his partner, Raglan. They took the mighty sorceress princess with the help of Raglan's strongest minion, Ashura. Sky now must save the princess and stop these evil minions!

Directions:

This game is a sidesscrolling action platform game. You can use different attack combos, such as punching and kicking. While in the air, you can kick, too! You'll eventually get to a boss, which you'll have to fight. (Duh!) If you beat the bosses, you can gain new spells, such as healing, lightning, and others! Collect the diamonds, also. Why? Collect 100 diamonds to get an extra life. When going to a new continent, you get to go to a bonus stage, which takes place in the sky!

Controls:  

A Button - No use
B Button - Jump
X Button - Use magic
Y Button - Punch/Kick (push rapidly to kick)
L Button - Change between spells
R Button - Change between spells
Start Button - Pause/Unpause
Select Button - No use

Hints:

Last Level With 30 Lives
Go to the password screen. There, you have to match the colored squares. Then press Start 

Tips:

Last level code
To go to the last level with the bonus stage completed, enter:

Great Tower complete:

0 T T 0
T X T -
X T 0 0
T X T 0

Note:
0 = Circular objects
T = Triangular objects
X = X-shaped objects

Caverns of Shirol shortcut
In the second room after riding the gondola up and down the large hill covered in spikes, there is a ledge with a small red potion. Walk up to the corner, crouch, and you will continue walking under the hill.  Go through the door, and ride the gondolas across to the other end. You will emerge on a ledge at the end of the third room, right before the boss 

Easy unlimited lives trick
In the third 'room' of the Lair of Kharyon stage, go with the water's flow clockwise until you reach the bottom part of the room. Once you do, swim up as far as you can, and the wall should stop you and push you upwards to a doorway. In the next room, swim all the way to the right, then swim upwards and grab the 1-UP.

Now, leave the room via the door right next to the 1-UP and then head back through the door. The 1-UP reappears! You can do this trick until you have 99 Lives, and then return to the stage later in the game and do it again if needed!

Hidden bonus stages
Once you've beaten the 'Gateway of Eternal Storms' level, go to the level's icon on the map and press up.  You'll get another flight bonus stage, a password hut, and a difficult extra level.

Temple Infernus Shortcut to boss
In the first room, go to the right, taking out enemies along the way. In second room, do the same, but do NOT go to the next room. About halfway through the room, (after the first green moving block and fire pit) there will be a platform at the top with a magic restore potion. To get there, the easiest way is to jump on the second green block as it moves toward you, and then use that to jump up to the platform. When you get the potion, press and hold DOWN to crouch and then, while crouching, go to the right. You will crawl through the wall and into a secret part of the room. Going right will teleport you into a room with two enemies that crawl along the walls; you can either dodge them or kill them with magic. The only exit to the room is in the upper left corner. It will take you directly to the boss.

NOTE: When you first enter the boss room, the health and magic bars will look like they have the max amount but are empty, and the lives and crystals will both be x99. When you first get hit or use magic, however, everything will change back to normal.

The player controls a young boy named Jerry, who was a prince and ruler of the Kingdom. Jerry has been transformed into a blob by a mysterious wizard at the behest of his jealous brother, Tom, who has a crush on the young princess Emi. In that incarnation, the player has to played as a little jelly bean with eyes, travelling across a photorealistic grassy landscape. The game itself eventually had graphics and terrain that were now more cartoony and cuteness, which attached to younger viewers.

The player also control only lines of defence are in flattening or stretching of his body to hit enemies, and in finding objects like balls to throw at them. The player can also run by holding down by pressing the Y button on the controllers. He can further stick to walls and ceilings by holding down the Y button as you jump towards them. The player can also advance through each level along a filmstrip map, and he/she can revisit previously-completed levels. Each level is a romp up and down hills, jumping between plaforms, and squeezing through pipes. Many enemies will come in the player's way, but they're easy to dispatch. Scattered around each level are a number of plants that open up to reveal balls, power-ups, 1ups, seeds, and jumping enhancers. Similar to Donkey Kong Country, the player must collect all 5 letters that spell JERRY in each level, if collecting them all will net you a couple of 1ups. It can be also be a save point as well.

Sony removed the entire storyline from the game, as well as all the towns in levels, in the North American version. However, the English Translation patch of the Japanese version with scenes is available online to play for a Emulator.

Tips:

Stage Select
When the title screen reads 'Push Start Button', press UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, SELECT, START

Snoopy Concert is less a game and more a collection of four smaller ones. Snoopy (of Peanuts fame, yes that Snoopy) is preparing to give a concert to the Peanuts gang, but so far, Marcie and Patty are the only ones who've shown up. Snoopy (and occasionally Woodstock) must then help solve the gang's various problems - with each character having a distinctly different minigame to play. Rerun's segment is a stroller chase, Schroeder's is a standard point-and-click style abstract adventure game, Linus's is a bit of a reflex test and Charlie Brown's is a trading game.

This is not the best game ever, but it is clever, cute, and a fun diversion while it lasts. Personally, I liked Schroeder's game the best.

Snoopy Concert is mouse compatible, so if you're playing via copier or flashcart (or if your emulator supports the SNES Mouse) be sure to try it the way it was meant to be played. It makes Rerun's segment quite a bit easier, that's for sure...

Tips:

Passwords: for Schroeder's mini-game

The password is in the form of a telephone number, which you 'dial' on the telephone that appears after selecting a character. Use a password to enter a specific stage within a character's mini-game.

The setting is a steampunk Victorian era England. Baron Fortesque, a grand inventor, has succeeded in his greatest creation yet - the Chaos Engine. Unfortunately (for the rest of the proud kingdom), the Engine then proceeds to both capture and assimilate its creator, then begins to change the countryside for the worse. Vile monsters and destructive automata appear everywhere, bringing the citizens to the verge of panic. This lures a number of mercenaries on a potentially rewarding quest to find the root of the problem and swiftly bring a full stop to it.

The player(s) choose two mercenaries from the group of six to take on the task of defeating the mad Baron Fortesque and the Chaos Engine itself. In one-player mode, the computer artificial intelligence controls the second player (in a co-operative fashion), so that one never has to fight the chaos alone.

The predetermined weapons of the six "heroes" are as follows:

The Cannon (Navvie) and the Rifle (Brigand) act like like a powerful forward shot. At their full power both weapons will have a tight 4 bullet spread.

The Shotgun (Thug) and the Machine Gun (Mercenary) are similar to one another. The shot gun has a wider spread, shoots more bullets in one go but and a slower rate of fire. The Machine gun however has a continuous fire rate and closer spread.

The Pistol (Gentleman) and the Lightening Gun (Preacher) are different to the other weapons. They do not fire bullets, except they have their own "shots," exclusive to each other. They both pass through monsters which in turn can cause damage to any monster or spawn device behind it. The Pistol's Flame shot can be upgraded to fire two shots at once where as the Lightning Gun's Lightning will only have one shot that eventually grows to a larger size.

Sub-Weapons/items can also be bought in the shop, as well as stats and lives, after every 2 stages. Each character will have one Sub-weapon/items each at the start. Only 2 Sub-weapons/items can be held at one time (one for each character) which, in 1 player mode, can be swapped by pressing the space bar. Holding down the fire button activates a Sub-weapon/items.

Sub-weapons/items include screen clearing sticks of dynamite, Bombs, Maps, First Aid Boxes, Molotov Cocktails and 8 way bursts of bullets. Items will similar effects are found in game as well.

Tips:

Sonic Blast Man
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Beat 'em Up
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Taito Corporation
Publisher: Taito Corporation
_________________________
*
The Super NES version is a beat 'em up. In this version Sonic Blastman must save the Earth from diverse kinds of evil forces, from street gangs and terrorists, to aliens and robots and finally, an evil clone of himself. The fight starts on a construction site in Earth and ends up in outer space.

The game is only for one player. As in any beat 'em up, the game consists of defeating the enemies on screen before continuing in the stage. Sonic Blastman can punch, jump, and grab his enemies, too. He also uses a special attack that knocks any enemy nearby, but it reduces some of his energy and dizzies him temporally. Another particular feature is the way Sonic Blastman holds his enemies: When he approaches his enemies, the is able to grab them in order to shake them and throw them back from him, or unleash a series of punches. However, if he punches repeatedly them, he will eventually hold them, so that he can blast them with a sonic wave, hit them with a whirlwind punch or throw them backwards. All of this throwing effects depend on the direction the d-pad is pressed when pressing the punch button. His most powerful attack is his D. Punch, which must be charged with a certain button, which can be discharged, and then punch. The D. Punch is limited.

The bonus levels are an adaption of the arcade version. The major difference is that since there is no punch pad, the player must charge strength by rotating repeatedly the d-pad.

Like with most beat 'em-ups of the era, the Japanese version had female enemies which were replaced by male ones in the American and European versions, mostly because of Nintendo of America's strict censorship issues at the time.

Tips:

Stage Select
Highlight Music on the Options menu, use Left and Right to select the stage then hold Select and press L, R, R, L, Start

Very Hard Mode (In Options Menu)
At the main screen hold L and R and press Start

Mostly inspired by the book and film The Poseidon Adventure, the players must escape the sinking ship Lady Crithania, which gets hit by a gigantic wave and is capsized, all within the time limit of an hour. However, the game is made more difficult by the lack of a visible timer (although it is shown if you injure yourself, in which case you'll lose five minutes) and the fact the ship rotates angles constantly and gradually gets filled with water.

The game features the possibility to play as four different characters, each one with the same gameplay control and same goal, but with a different story.

Each character can take up to seven other survivors, some of which have different value to each character, and all of them have different requirements in how to get to them and how to make them follow the player. Depending on how many survivors the player finds, who they are and how valuable they are to the character the gamer plays as, the ending will vary. Because of the massive amount of possible combinations of survivors at the end of the game, there are technically hundreds of endings to the game.

King Magridd, ruler of the Freil Empire, is a greedy man. His only desire is to possess all the money in the world.

One day the King overheard a conversation regarding Dr. Leo, the town's so-called "genius" inventor. An idea suddenly came to him. "Maybe I can obtain all the world's wealth by striking a deal with the King of Evil."

Dr. Leo was imprisoned by the King and ordered to construct a machine to summon Deathtoll. Even though it was painful, this was not a difficult task for Dr. Leo.

When Deathtoll was summoned, the King told him he wanted more than anything to obtain the wealth of the world. Deathtoll made a proposition: "The life of one living being in exchange for one gold piece."

The proposition was accepted, and from that day on all living beings began to disappear. They either became servants of Deathtoll or were banished to Monster Lairs.

--From the SNES Soul Blazer instruction manual.

Tips:

Unlimited Experience
After getting the Zantestu Sword (from Leo's Lab) go to the Fire Shrine and kill all the scorpions in the first room and go to the lair you unlocked in the left-most plat form and it will release a fairy who will give you 1 experience every time you talk to her.

"Space Ace goes where no man wants to go...straight down the toilet!"

While playing this game, I ran into a few snags, and decided to seek help on the internet. After all, information for just about everything from mountain climbing to "at home bikini waxes using old Christmas candles" can be found on the net, right? Well, why couldn't I find any information about it anywhere on the entire web? Am I the only one who's ever played this awful game??!! Well, if I am, 'tis a far better thing that I suffer alone than that the rest of the world suffer with me. My only hope is that those of you who are reading this might not yet have suffered through this game, and might heed my advice and ignore the semi-okay screen shots you might have seen of this game. THIS GAME SUCKS EGGS!

Er?nothing to see?or hear, rather?here. The music in this game is passable, but the sound effects reek. They're the same old, run of the mill, corny space game sounds, and they sound canned and unimpressive. I think maybe some of them were abducted from the laserdisc sounds where they were more at home, probed then stripped for parts, then stuffed into this cartridge. The annoying sounds and monotonous music will join the effort to drive you nuts and make you sick of this game faster than the speed of light.

Sorry, Ace?your game sucks. This is the second Don Bluth laserdisc game that was popular in the arcade and stuffed into the action/adventure format in a SNES cartridge. Well, Dragon's Lair managed to survive the translation with a few flaws, but some remaining playability. Space Ace, however, didn't survive the transition, and what we're left with is it's rotting corpse, stuffed into some semi-attractive retail packaging, and waiting to stink up the likes of your SNES system. This ones an Ace in the hole?the black hole of video games we wish were never made. Forget about it.

"Better than bad, but not quite good"

It's football!...sort of...

To get to the mandatory 400 word limit, I want to recap a cold day in Florida in 1993. I had gotten my SNES a year before, and all was right with the world. Soon the juggernauts at Rare would unleash ''Donkey Kong Country''. It was Christmas, and I opened up the usual selection of sweet games.

There was one from Aunt Christie, though. She wasn't, isn't, and never will be a gamer. I opened it up. ''Space Football?! What is this?''

I was used to classics like Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. This would be a true test of my gaming mettle...

Space Football is one of those truly mediocre games - not bad enough to warrant ridicule, but not quite good enough to deserve praise. It has all the earmarks of a slightly sloppy third-party SNES game - somewhat poorly executed mode 7 scaling, very old-school color palette, MIDI-like sound. This is decidedly strange now, of course, because everyone knows the SNES could pull off amazing graphics - DKC, Star Fox, Yoshi's Island, etc. - and great music - DKC, Star Fox, Yoshi's Island, etc. :).

It's ''one on one'' ''football'' played in hoverpod thingies. There is an energy ball which you can carry into your opponents goal...and he's trying to do the same to you. You can't hold the ball for too long, either, so you play like polo - moving the ball up the field by ''shooting'' it. The mode 7 playfield is littered with various obstacles/zones which hamper your progress. You can bump and beat the crap out of the other guy's pod thingie to get the ball, as well. Two players can even battle it out, split screen.

All in all, the game isn't horrible, but the repetitive music and somewhat confusing menus, interface, and presentation hamper the enjoyment. The backgrounds sometimes blend in with the course, and the game design just isn't that interesting. It's fun, but not for too long. Every minute you spend on "Space Football" is a minute you could use to play "Super Mario Kart."

Why am I even reviewing this game? Well, I got it as a Christmas present and I've always wanted to exorcise the demons of ''Space Football''. Now I can donate it to charity or something and never speak of it again. This is the first review of the game, and, let's hope, the last.

Thanks, GameFAQS.

Space Invaders: The Original Game
Platform: Super NES

Release Year: 1996
Developer: Taito
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: 1
_________________________

Taito and Nintendo have brought back the classic Space Invaders game, with very little modification. An incredibly popular game when it was first released, Space Invaders has inspired many reproductions over the years, although this type of game has been eclipsed by modern graphics-heavy, music-laden games.

In any case, the subtitle, "The Original Game," is pretty much the truth. The graphics are almost identical to the original Atari release. There is almost no animation, things just move back and forth on the screen. There is no background music, also true to the original, but the original sound effects are there, and still amazingly good for such a simple game.

The main difference is that this new edition has a competitive two-player mode. Not only can you take turns and compete for points, but you can face-off in a side-by-side split screen contest, in the tradition of Tetris and Dr. Mario.

If you like a game of survival and high scores, and if you like direct competition outside of the fighting game genre, then give Space Invaders a try. You'll love it!

Space Knight Tekkaman Blade
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Maze
Release Year: 2004
Original Title: Uchuu no Kishi Tekkaman Blade
Translated By: D
Version: 1.0
_________________________
*
This game is laughably bad. Most of it's played in a sidescrolling shootemup format. Your character chops up generic-looking aliens with his dual-pronged spear thing, collects the occasional powerup, takes a lot of hits, and tends to get snagged on tiny floating obstacles and pushed off the back edge of the screen. Hit detection's poor, your ranged attack is pathetically weak for the amount of damage enemies tend to take, and you move about as fast as a sunday driver. Did I mention that the colors are extremely washed out and the music sounds like it's coming from a Genesis?

When you reach the end of the level, you're transported into a 1-on-1 boss fight, Street Fighter style. Only, the slightest tap of the controller sends your character zooming around in every direction, your attacks again don't do nearly enough damage for the time limit imposed on you, and again the music and color usage are pretty abysmal. Suffice it to say, if Street Fighter 2 played like this, the genre may have never taken off.

There is painfully little story in it as well. It's largely boss fight chats, and even these don't last very long.

All in all, Tekkaman Blade is a stinker through and through. It's a pity, as it really could have been something really good, but it fails to achieve even the most minimal of quality standards.

Translation Description:

To D-Boy's credit, he and byuu managed to do an amazing amount of work on the game. They added an intro, expansive text scrolls, and pre-level briefings on exactly what's going on in the anime that the game is based off of. It really is quite amazing, not in the least that they cared enough about the game to give it such a world-class treatment. Beautiful though their work is, it doesn't do anything for the gameplay, which remains awful.

Tips:

After you press Start on the Title Screen and the menu pops up, press: L + R and then Start while highlighting 2P Play

Release Year: 1992
Developer: Compile
Publisher: Toho
Players: 1
_________________________

Space Megaforce is a vertical-scrolling shooter game, published by Toho and part of the Aleste series by Compile. In a traditional fashion, the player pilots a space ship through a variety of locales crawling with enemy squadrons to shoot down, though the story in the Japanese version is different from American and European ones. However, Super Aleste also offers a "Short Game", where only a set of small levels are played, with the emphasis on scoring as many points as possible.

There are eight types of weapons to use, and each can be powered up by collecting chips (small spherical items). Picking up chips causes the player's current weapon to level-up, to a maximum of six. There are two types of chips to find; Orange chips contribute to a level-up, but at higher levels, more chips are required to reach the next level. Green chips make the weapon level up instantly. Each weapon has a function that can be manipulated with the Shot-Control button, changing around the weapon's abilities to suit different situations. Switching to another weapon is done by picking up a numbered item, with initials representing one of the eight weapons.

Tips:

Warning Signal
On the main menu, press Select twice and hold it. The option selection should be highlighted. Press Start.  During game play, the last digit of the score will indicate the level of danger, with zero displaying for low danger areas to seven for high danger areas.

_________________________

Spanky's Quest is a game, published in 1991 by Natsume, for the Super Nintendo. The main character is a monkey named Spanky who attacks by throwing different kinds of balls.

The game begins with a cutscene where a witch traps Spanky. Spanky attacks by throwing a small purple bubble. He can then bounce the bubble on his head. Every time he bounces the bubble, the bubble grows and changes color. The bubble can then be popped, depending the bubble's size and color, different types of sports balls will fly out of the bubble destroying enemies touched by the balls. For example, a purple bubble will release a baseball and the larges orange bubble will release several basketballs. If an enemy is touched by a bubble, he will simply be stunned and unable to move for a moment.

The enemies in the game are all different types of fruits mostly. The soundtrack is characterized by an upbeat jazz-like style of music with creative bass patterns.

Attacks:

The first time a bubble is thrown, it is purple. If it is popped, a baseball comes out and can usually only hit one enemy at a time. If a purple bubble is bounced on Spanky's head, it turns green. When the green bubble is popped, it creates a string of soccer balls that can usually take out a line of enemies. Bouncing the green bubble creates a yellow bubble that, when popped, becomes a gyrating volleyball, causing damage to an area of increasing radius. Bouncing the bubble a fourth and last time, the largest bubble is reached. When this orange bubble is popped, it releases several basketballs that shower down on a wide range of enemies.

Sparkster is a 16-bit generation side scrolling platformer produced and released in 1994 by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, directed by Hideo Ueda (Axelay). The eponymous main character is an opossum knight who fights an army of wolves and robots. He is armed with a sword that can fire energy bolts and a rocket pack that allows him to fly short distances.

Although it is another game that features Sparkster, it has no storyline continuity with the Sega Genesis versions of Rocket Knight Adventures, thereby making it more of a spin-off, or perhaps an alternate universe instead.

Sparkster was awarded Best Sound Effects of 1994 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

I played "Kirby's Dream Course" and loved it, and once I had finished it, I began to get depressed because, as far as I could determine, it was the only game of its kind, on any console or computer format. Then one day, browsing through the bargain bin at my local flea market, I came across a cartridge that had a picture on it that looked remarkably similar to the kinds of courses played in the Kirby game. So I picked it up for a few bucks, went home and fired up the SNES. I didn't sleep much that night.

"Special Tee Shot" is, like Kirby's Dream Course, (webmasters note: Special Tee Shot was later redesigned and released as Kirby's Dream Course) a game that combines miniature golf, pool and some wacky cartoon elements with awesome gameplay to give you more than your money's worth. The basic premise of the game is simple - succeed in making par for a course, and you are allowed to continue to the next, harder level. There are eight holes on each course, but take note that making par, even on the 'beginner' stage, is very hard indeed. And it is this level of difficulty that makes the game so addictive - you are never made to feel as though the game cannot be beaten. Victory is always tantalisingly within your grasp, but a preternatural will and skill are required to make that ever-elusive par.

The graphics are stunningly and lovingly created in isometric 3D, and the 3D is used to very good effect on most of the levels. Water hazards look watery, and sand patches look and behave like sand, as they should. The animation of the ball and hazards is truly awesome, and movement between holes is straightforward and doesn't interrupt the playing experience too much. The graphic designer(s) have managed to strike a fine balance between the cutesy cartoon element and the serious strategy element - things look cartoony, but when you need pixel-perfect ball placement, it's easy to achieve.

The hazards and helpers in "Special Tee Shot" are many and varied, giving you flowers that sing if your little red ball (who just happens to be the cutesy hero of the game) knocks into them, passionless blobs of water with eyes that suck your ball in and make you lose a stroke, and strange glass cones that knock your ball about like it's in a pinball machine.

It took me about two minutes to get to grips with the control method - like many golf games on consoles, you line up your shot, hit the button, select your spin, hit the button again and time your next press to control the power of the shot. And, though this control method is very simple, it takes a good few games to master. All of which adds to the replayability of the game, as you always feel that you could have done better if only you'd given the ball a little left spin on that last shot.

The music in the game is of very high quality as SNES music goes, with the main title managing to be memorable without being annoying, and various little signature tunes are used to good effect when specific events happen. The very cute singing flowersare a nice touch, even though you'll generally want to avoid making them sing, as it usually means a dropped stroke.

All told, "Special Tee Shot" is a game well worth checking out. If you generally hate golf games, this may be the one that makes you re-evaluate your attitude. However, if you're a shoot-em-up or RPG afficionado, you might want to steer clear of it.

"Caramba!"

Most Looney Tunes afuciandos agree that Speedy Gonzales is one of the worst Looney Tunes characters of all time. Why Nintendo decided to make a game starring the miserable little rodent is beyond me. I would rather play a game starring Pepe Le Pew.

The story is that a bunch of peasant mice have been kidapped by Sylvester and some of his feline henchmen, and placed them in cages scattered all over the countryside (and beyond). Why they just didn't lock them all away in one spot is beyond me. You, as Speedy, must race through the levels, dodging enemies and jumping ledges, saving as many mice as you can.

Speedy runs as fast as he can, jumping over pits, collecting pieces of cheese, finding the occasional mouse and bouncing off of springs. Sound familiar? You bet it is! It is a direct steal of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and while it looks much prettier, the flavour that made it a success is missing. The level are large mazes, in which you'll either get lost immidiately or finish before you know where you are. Speedy must also fight the occasional boss, which ranges from an-orangutan-could-do-this to what-happened-to-all-my-hair.

GRAPHICS: At least it looks nice. Speedy is nice and large, and he makes some cute expressions, like when he drinks hot sauce and breathes fire, and humourous animations, like when he gets squashed flat, frozen solid, or electrocuted. The enemies look good, even though they don't always make sense. (What ARE those orange heads?)

CONTROL: Speedy's only weapon is a kick, which takes a second to wind up and has almost no range. You'll find yourself crashing into enemies a lot. Speedy takes quite a while to get up to speed, and jumping is tiresome, as you'll overshoot or come up short of your destination.

SOUND: Speedy says ''Arriba! Arriba!'' in a scratchy voice that sounds nothing like him. There is annoying MIDI music, and when your (pointless) score is tallied, it plays an annoying tone that is 3 times louder than it should be. The only sound effect that sticks in my mind is the sound of polar bears belching when you bounce on their bellies.

There is one more annoyance that I feel deserves its own mention. Load time. In a SNES game? I'm not kidding. You start a level and are informed how many mice there are to find in the level. The screen goes black. Hmm... nothing's happening. Ah! The music is starting! Hmm... it's still a black screen. Ah! Here we are! THIS IS NOT A PC GAME and there is not enough in this game to justify slow load time.

This game is for pre-schoolers and die-hard Speedy fans only.

Spellcraft is based on the PC game of the same name. There is a beta of the game floating around on the internet, and seems rather complete. It is compatible with the Snes mouse, although it seems rather clunky (for instance, you must click both buttons to get to the menu). Developed by Ybarra Productions.

Nintendo Power mentioned in their May 1993 issue that they expected the game to be released in the fall of 1993.

A 14 issue mini-series. A great super-hero. An awesome anti-hero. Combine all that together and you get Maximum Carnage. Cletus Cassidy is a psychotic killer being held in a mental asylum. On one nasty night a red symbiont (Venom's son) fuses with Cassidy to create Carnage. Carnage, along with Doppleganger and Demigoblin (just to name a few) are terrorizing New York City. Who out there can stop them? Only Spider-man, of course. Well, with the help of Venom and a few others, they can save his beloved city from destruction.

Well, this is a pretty straightforward beat em' up. It reminds me of Streets of Rage. The graphics are good (nothing special), but they let you know who is who.

Directions:

You take on enemies with little variety, most are different models with different colors. Do not let that keep you away, though, this game is a very good adaptation of the comic series. Spider man and Venom have only a select amount of moves, including: punching, kicking, web shield, and a move to slam two enemies into each other. You can also swing on your web/suit to zip through a section and swing kick people. You should also note that Venom uses his suit and not webbing in this. You will also pick up health packs (very limited) and one-ups. There is no save/password feature, so fight well.

Controls:

A Button - Tap to fire webbing. Hold to form shield. (Venom) Tap to extend arm and grab enemy
B Button - Jump. Release from web when swinging, or release from wall when climbing
X Button - Swing from web
Y Button - Punch, pick up object, or throw object/enemy
L Button - Scroll through super heroes you can summon
R Button - Summon selected super hero
Start Button - Pause game
Select Button - Select hero

Tips:

Spider-Man & Venom-Maximum Carnage

5 continues
Enter the following on the Start screen with Cont. 2.  You must do so VERY fast though. Very, VERY fast, or it
wont work.  Up-Up-Down-A-B-Select

5 lives
Enter the following on the Start screen with Controller 2.  You must do so VERY fast though. Very, VERY fast, or it wont work.  Down-Y-B-R-L-Select

Easy Points
You get 7500 points for every final blow to a Super villain. But you can take advantage of this in the easiest way:  In the Climb stage, take out Doppleganger whenever he attacks you. You'll get 7500 points every time you hit him, and you can keep doing this as he reappears after a while. Keep doing this and you can get up to 999, 999 points!

Hidden Stage
After the stage Prospect Park II, choose to play as Venom. When the cinema scene plays, repeatedly press the X and Y buttons. If done successfully, you will be taken to the hidden Statue Of Liberty stage.

Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety is a side-scrolling beat 'em up video game and sequel to Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage, released for Sega Mega Drive and Super NES and then ported to PC, in which one or two players could team up as Spider-Man and Venom to defeat the evil symbiote Carnage. The game boasts a large number of thugs that the player has to defeat: heavily armed Jury and Venom's symbiote children.

There is also cameo assistance from Captain America, Ghost Rider, Hawkeye, and Daredevil.

The game was met with less critical response by the gaming community, especially when compared to its predecessor.

Of particular note is that the title is misleading - the plot of the comic book series Venom: Separation Anxiety involves Venom's five symbiote spawn attempting to force Eddie (without his symbiote) to help them communicate with their own symbiotes. The events of the game more closely follow the events of Venom's first limited series, Venom: Lethal Protector.

Unlimited Lives
To get unlimited lives it's kind of tricky it usually works better with 2 players but it still possible with 1 player. First get to a boss and make sure you have an extra hero to help you (Captain America, Dare Devil, Ghost Rider, etc?) Get the boss to low health and get yourself to 1 life and low health. As soon as he kills you press 'L' to get a hero's help he will kill the boos. In the next level you will have zero lives and you can die as many times as you want.  BUT MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE ZERO LIVES DO NOT PICK UP LIVES IT WILL SET IT TO 1 LIFE AND YOU HAVE TO RE DO IT. If you have zero you can die and it will go to 9. I honestly dont no how many lives you truly have but it is a lot probably like 100 but that should be more then enough.

Release Year: 1992
Developer: Software Creations

Every stage of Spider-Man and the X-Men is exceedingly difficult in that they all require that the player have some knowledge of the stage prior to playing. Even knowing the exact layout each stage can be difficult and can require ridiculously precise timing. A great example of this is one of the hardest stages in video game history: the Juggernaut stage, also known as Wolverine's second stage. In this stage the player is being chased down by the boss (Juggernaut) from the very beginning. There are only two ways to damage the boss. The first way to cause damage is to drop anvils down either on his head or in his path. The second way to damage the boss is to slice the Juggernaut with the normal punch move or the uppercut. This requires that the player get close enough to actually hit the boss, leaving little room for error.

The game is also loaded with instances of 'cheap deaths' usually characterized by trial and error. For instance, Gambit's second stage consists of a platform constantly moving up. The screen does not shift left or right, it simply shifts up at a constant rate until the boss. Oftentimes a player can choose different paths. Once a path is chosen there is no going back. Unfortunately many paths are death traps. Without any way of knowing which areas are traps the player simply has to learn through luck or through trial and error. Several times a player may take the correct path only to see that the other path is loaded with ammo, stars (which accumulate to an extra live) and bombs. Of course, the player that took the path loaded with items was quickly squished to death by the rising platform. One spot in the middle of the stage is loaded with stars but there is absolutely no way to get to them leaving players to wonder whether it was a programming glitch or just a joke.

Many gamers also express disdain towards the games ending which is as short as the game is difficult.

Tips:

100 Star Glitch
In Gambits First Stage, when you get to the fourth Green Globe (above the B) on the destroyable steps, try to jump on the step below it. Then try to jump over the globe and the star above it, right off the top of the screen. Try to land on the same spot you jumped from(Its kinda like jump right, but turn left when you go back down). Your stars will increase by about 30-60, depending on how well you can land, but DO NOT touch the Green Globe or the single star above it. Let us remember, 100 stars collect in Gambits Stage can lead to a life. By repeating the procedure
over and over, you may build up to 8 or more extra lives before the rolling wheel hits you. If you repeat the procedure enough times, you may build up to 99 lives, where from then on out, you can try to beat everyone elses stage without having to beat Gambits First Stage until later.

"An interesting, innovative game, but the controls will make your head spin!"

Yet another "strange" game of the early 90's. This one is very innovative and very irritating at the same time.

Story: 7/10

If I remember correctly, a star exploded, and its core went flying into space. It whizzed past some planets and caused them to spin on their axis much faster. How they didn't get fried like cosmic chickens, I don't know. Back on Earth, some astronomers noticed these high-speed spinning planets and became interested in them. Upon further study, these planets had gems on them that would make a very good fuel. However, they all were spinning way too fast for humans to land on them. So, they crafted a top-looking robot, G.E.R.A.L.D., to collect the gems for them.

Graphics: 8/10

This was released in 1992, so the 3-D effects probably were pretty nifty. Now, it kinda looks like everything was drawn in Mario Paint. Still, the 3-D effects are good, and nothing looks like it would belong on the Atari 2600 instead. The terrain ranges from bleaches to Lego blocks(!). The aliens range from evil version of Pac-Man to penguins that can run really fast. You can get crushed by boulders that look like Easter eggs. The gems kinda look like these odd geometric shapes, like spheres and black pyramids.

Sound: 7/10

The sound isn't so bad, but it's not exactly memorable either. The opening and stage select themes are okay, and I liked the Game Over theme (which you'll probably hear a lot!). Fortunately, none of the music is overly annoying. The gems make a "shinng!" sound when you grab them, while the spherical ones make a "gulp!" noise. The monsters making a weird "quack!" sound when you kill them(?!).

Controls: 4/10

Argh! The controls can be pretty sloppy. The D-Pad is on a diagonal this time. That means Up doesn't make you move north, it makes you move northwest. So when you first start the game and press Up and Left, or any other two directions, you'll find yourself moving in an arc instead! You'll be fighting yourself trying to remember that the game is on an angle. The B and X buttons are G.E.R.A.L.D.'s brakes, and you'll find yourself mashing on of those buttons a lot. G.E.R.A.L.D. has a bad habit of moving way to fast and moves in weird arcs when you try to switch directions. You practically have to use the brakes every time you want it to change directions...unless of course, you want it to go over that ledge. The A and Y buttons speed G.E.R.A.L.D. up, which helps it get over ramps or hurry up when there's a timer on a level. However, you can easily lose control of it when it's moving that fast. The L and the R buttons change the camera angle, and there's a log pause in between switching angles.

Gameplay: 6/10

This game is a cross between a puzzle game and an action game. Your job is to collect all the gems in each level. Once you grab all the gems, you can move on to the next planet. When all the small planets move on, you finally move on to the big planet (Easydizzy or Spindizzy). To collect all the gems, you either have to solve puzzles, or guide G.E.R.A.L.D. through a maze. The puzzles and mazes range of easy to "wanna hang yourself with the controller." There are a few of them I've encountered that are nearly impossible. Sometimes, there's also a timer on a level, and you must get G.E.R.A.L.D. through the maze before it runs out. The problem is, there never seems to be enough time to get through those mazes. Finally, after each level, you get a bonus round which allows you to collect extra gems within a time limit. In these rounds, the round simply ends if you run out of time or fall off a ledge.

G.E.R.A.L.D. has a health bar, and it goes down every time you fall off a ledge, fall down from too far a height, get crushed by an Easter egg-oops!-I mean boulder, or touch a monster. It also slowly loses fuel by just standing around. It can replenish its fuel bar by grabbing gems or flags. Flags also temporarily make G.E.R.A.L.D. lose no fuel when it touches a monster. If G.E.R.A.L.D. runs out of fuel, it breaks down and the game is over. You also lose if you run out of time in a regular level. Then you have the option of starting the level over, starting a new level, or starting a new game.

As I've mentioned before, the puzzles and mazes can get pretty tough and irritating. Couple that with the sloppy controls, and this makes a very frustrating game!

Breakdown!

Good points:
-Innovative gameplay.
-Good 3-D graphics for 1992.
-Good for puzzle lovers.

Bad points:
-Tough or nearly impossible puzzles can be downright aggravating.
-Timed levels never seem to have enough time on the clock, even in easy mode.
-Very sloppy controls. You'll be mashing the brake buttons a lot.
-D-Pad is on an angle which can cause some confusion. Confusion that might make you lose a couple of times.

What should you do?

Your best bet is to borrow this from a friend or emulate it. If your friends don't have it, or if you don't want to emulate, then rent this or buy it really cheap. If you're a die-hard puzzle fan, then I definitely recommend this game!

Origin of the Lylatian Conflict

The Lylat solar system, located near the center of the Milky Way galaxy, is made up of several bountiful planets. No fewer than three of these worlds were home to civilizations teeming with industrious inhabitants. The other planets in the system provided boundless natural resources. The comfortable lifestyle enjoyed by the Lylatians was the envy of the galaxy until the coming of the evil Emperor Andross.

Emperor Andross was once known as Doctor Andross, a scientific genius who worked at an advanced lab on Corneria, the fourth planet in the Lylat system. Every since his childhood, Andross brilliance outshone that of other children. As an adult, Dr. Andross began developing a power engine based on hyper-spatial energy. Selfish and blinded by ambition, he repeatedly conducted dangerous experiments in the heart of Corneria most populated city. After many warnings from the planet ruling council, he was finally banished from the planet for endangering the inhabitants of Corneria.

Out of sight, out of mind. The inhabitants of Corneria soon forgot the menace of Dr. Andross. One day, however, Corneria small defense force detected some unusual happenings on Venom, the first planet in the Lylat system. Strange unidentified flying objects were monitored maneuvering above the planet in large numbers. It was not long before the self appointed Emperor Andross, who had fled to Venom, declared war on Corneria.

The planet Venom had been completely remade by Emperor Andross into a gigantic military base. Andross hoped that with his military power, he could soon control all the planets in the Lylat system. General Pepper, the commanding officer of Corneria defense force, decided to dispatch the super-high-performance combat ship ARWING to the defense of the planet, even though it was in the prototype stage of development. Because of the urgency of the threat to Corneria, however, he did not have time to train pilots for these advanced fighters.

We need the Star Fox Team!! This is the call sent out by General Pepper. You are Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox team, a group of adventurers with outstanding combat skill. Your mission is to penetrate the defenses of the planet Venom and defeat the forces led by Emperor Andross. Your ability to maneuver the ARWING fighter will make the difference between the return of peace to the Lylat system and the fall of Corneria to the evil Emperor. As team leader, you are also responsible for the safe return of your Star Fox teammates.

--From the SNES Star Fox instruction manual.

Overview:

The Starfox team, Fox McCloud, Falco Lombardi, Peppy Hare, and Slippy Toad live in Corneria. All was at piece. Until Dr. Andross, a very intelligent man, started doing dangerous experiments, which got him banished to Venom. Angered, Dr. Andross made Venom rage war on Cornernia. The Cornerian army leader, Pepper, called the StarFox team to get to Venom and destroy Andross before Corneria was destroyed!

Star Fox was a great idea for a game, but I think the SNES lacked the capability needed. The Nintendo 64 version is still one of my favorite games today. These two games were the same except for the graphics and a few other exceptions. This version is still a lot of fun to play, so give it a try if you like flight sims. 

Directions:

Classic flight sim game here. You must destroy enemies by shooting them to bits. After completing each level, you get a choice of 3 levels, each with a different difficulty level. Middle is easy, Upper is medium, and Down is hard. You must face a boss at the end of each level, so be ready! Have fun, gamers!

A Button - Nova Bomb
B Button - Brake
X Button - Boost
Y Button - Blaster
L Button - Roll
R Button - Roll

Black Hole
To enter the black hole, a secret area on the map with no apparent way in, you must enter Level 1-2 (Asteroid
Belt) and keep going until you find a spinning asteroid bar. Hit the center of the asteroid bar just before you hit it. Do it with the next 2. If you hit all 3 bars right before you hit them (fly through where the breakable asteroid was....) A Laughing asteroid will appear. Shoot it repeatedly to open the gateway to the Black Hole.  There are three level warps in the Black Hole. Fly through and look around this Lost ship graveyard

Enter another dimension
Choose level three, then go to the asteroid belt and keep shooting the second big asteroid until it is destroyed. A bird-like object will fly out. Do not shoot it. Ram into it to travel 'out of this dimension'. Shoot the paper-like objects. The boss does not have a life meter, just icons (until they display three 7s) Shoot 'THE END' letters until they are in
the right position. The letters will be orange when they are correct.

The holy grail of unreleased Snes games finally came to life several years ago with the release of Star Fox 2 final beta rom. Long had it been sought after, with only tastes of it from two early alpha roms. The game promised freedom from the rails of the original, and a new walker mode, and it delivered. With its release date so close to the release of the N64, it was finally shelved, along with the other Super FX games, Commanche and FX Fighter.

Through the great efforts of Aeon Genesis (Gideon Zhi, d4s, Fusoya, and satsu), we now have a patch that fixes the remaining issues with the beta, as well as translate it English. You can download it from the Aeon Genesis website.

A promotional cartridge, Star Fox: Super Weekend (Official Competition) (titled Star Wing: Super Weekend (Official Competition) in Europe), was released as part of the game's marketing campaign in Europe and the US. It featured time-limited single player mode on modified stages, as well as an exclusive bonus level.[6] According to IGN, "The altered start-up screen displays 'Official Competition Cartridge'. Depending on the points scored, players could win a t-shirt, a jacket, or even trips to international destinations. An estimated 2000 cartridges were made."[6]

In the United States, The Star Fox: Super Weekend Competition was played by tens of thousands of competitors in malls across the country. Stores such as KB Toys and Suncoast Video (usually any store that carried Super Nintendo games participated) hosted the event.

In the United Kingdom, the competition was known as the Star Wing Challenge and was held in gaming shops across the country on May 29 1993.

Nintendo Netherlands also held the Starwing competition at various game selling stores in early 1993. The winner of each day won a large Starwing poster. Starwing competition was also used during the Dutch Nintendo Championship in October 1993-1996.

Genre: Role Playing Game , Fantasy
Release Year: 2003
Players: 1
Original Title: Star Ocean
Translated By: DeJap Translations
Version: 1.0
_________________________

If you've played Star Ocean: The Second Story, you've pretty much got the idea behind Star Ocean. This isn't a knock against either game, though; it's more of a testament to how groundbreaking the original was. Er, is. You've got the same basic combat system, along with lots of skills that can be leveled up, and a whole crapload of mostly-useless items. Private Actions are also possible, where you hit a button before you go into a town, and your party splits up to explore the town individually. In the end, though, it just ends up as a way to have even more people to talk to in town. Though it has a use or two.

The combat's very different, though. All the action takes place on one non-scrolling screen. This eliminates a lot of running around like a dumbass from the second game, and makes the battles a lot more strategic. This also makes the "run-behind-the-enemy-and-then-attack" maneuver invaluable, as there seem to be a lot of enemies that block all your attacks from the front. Of course, in the second game, all that move did was suddenly make you run around in circles instead of, you know, attacking.

I know, comparisons in reviews suck. Especially if you have no idea that a Star Ocean 2 (or 3!) even exists. But really, Star Ocean is a great game with beautiful graphics and music by The Man, Motoi Sakuraba. It has one of those "hey, if you're not at a certain level right now, you're going to be slaughtered here, but oh wait, you can't go back to previous areas from this point so you can level up" things going on at the end, but up until then it's great.

Translation Description:

Much, much better than the last patch, this is for all intents and purposes a complete translation. However, there are a few things missing (Yes/No balloons, elemental icons) and as such it's not yet a truly "Complete" translation. Another patch should be out in the future that resolves all these issues.

Tips:

Oracle Room
After you have beaten the game, reload your saved game and have somebody use the Oracle specialty. You will be sent to a secret area. Each door takes you to a room where you can talk to members of the game's development staff. To exit, take the passage on the lower left or right corner. The lower right corner will take you to the Revorse Tower. The lower left corner will take you to Tatoroy.

Seven Star Ruin
After beating the final boss of the game, use the oracle skill, and go through the south-west door.  You'll end up in the Tataroy arena. Now go one step up, to arrive in the Seven Star Ruin. This secret dungeon has 30 levels and no save points.  It contains super hard enemies, and a even harder boss.  At the bottom is some of the best items in the game.

"not quite like being in the TV show, but still fun"

The storyline of Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Crossroads of Time is set in the first season of the TV show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Players assume the character of Commander Benjamin Sisko for most of the game, but at certain points also play as other characters such as Major Kira Nerys, Dr. Julian Bashir, and Constable Odo. The graphics are 2D, side-scrolling, and the music is fairly good, although it can't compare to newer games with more advanced technology, it is still good. Players can walk around on the station Deep Space Nine and interact with many characters familiar to those who have seen the TV show. The characters's lines in the game fit their portrayal in the show, which adds to the atmosphere and gives a feeling that the player is acting out an episode of the show. However, the places on the station where one can actually go are quite limited. Fortunately, the game does not keep Sisko and crew on the station the whole time.

Some Bajoran terrorists are causing trouble on the station, which eventually leads to a fast-paced chase in a runabout (a type of small spaceship) through the wormhole into the Gamma Quadrant, and also to the planet Bajor. Players make use of many items and technology depicted in the TV show, such as phasers, tricorders, replicator, hypospray, PADD, and the computers of Federation starships. The gameplay can be very difficult at times, but passwords are given at certain points to keep track of progress. There are often time limits, such as for finding the bilitrium explosives planted by the terrorists at the beginning of the game; the game will end if the task is not completed in time. Also, Sisko can quite easily fall to his death in many areas, even on board the station, as the controls for jumping and grabbing hold of ledges is a bit awkward.

The handheld phaser is difficult to aim; it is often easier to hit things by just holding down the button when firing the phaser and sweeping it across the screen, rather than trying to aim at your target. The controls for flying the runabout are better, but the runabout has few features. Overall, the game was rather difficult, but still fun, although I did become very frustrated in several areas.

Starfleet Academy - Starship Bridge Simulator is a video game for the Super Nintendo and Sega 32X systems which was released in 1994 by Interplay, the same group which produced many later Star Trek starship games. It did not have a large following, as its interface was not considered easy to use, and had relatively simplistic game mechanics.

Nevertheless, it marks a significant item in this genre, as it was a crucial prelude to the more widely known PC game Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, and to many of the more well-known starship games which followed. It was the first Star Trek computer game of significance to appear as a starship simulator in the modern age using graphics, after a long absence and decline in such games, during the decade following the age of text-based DOS games.

Tips:

Choose Star Trek Series Names
Press X, Y, X, Y at the 'New Cadet Registration' screen. Then hold L, R, Select and press A, B, A, B.

New ships in Training Simulator
Hold down L, R, and Select, and then press A, Y, B, Y at any of the Ship Selection Menus

Win Mission #000: Kobiyashi Maru
To win in the Kobiyashi Maru mission, you do the following.  First, enter the codes for 'Secret Cadet Names' and
'Star Trek Series Names'. Choose the names 'James T. '  and 'Kirk' for your cadet names. Next, play the game through like normal. When it comes time for the Klingon Birds of Prey to attack you in the Kobiyashi Maru scenario, open hailing frequencies to the Klingons. The Klingons should respond sounding surprised, then offer escort through the Neutral Zone to the Kobiyashi Maru.(This is the absolute only way to win in this no-win situation, but it's not necessary to beat the game.)

Future's Past is an adventure game in which the player is investigating the relationship between the Romulans, an alien race called the Chodak, and a temporal device. The game plays as an episode of the series does, in that the player communicates with members of the crew and interacts with them in a variety of ways. In game areas include the main bridge, transporter room, conference room, alien ships, and planet surfaces.

The main bridge offers a large amount of interactivity. Here the player can interact with each crew member, interviewing them to gain knowledge for the mission and to solicit opinions on how to proceed. The bridge has a variety of terminals, including the Conn, communications, engineering, the main computer, and access to the transporter room and conference room. The engineering terminal gives the player control over ship repair duties, in a similar style to the PC game Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity. The main computer offers a material to research for missions, and general information about the Star Trek universe. The Conn is the ship's navigational control and is where the player plots course and speed to various game destinations. In the conference room the player is briefed with the crew regarding how to proceed at various points throughout the story.

When the player goes to the transporter room, planning to beam to a destination, he can choose his crew to bring along. Each crew member has stats that decide how effective he will be at certain tasks, such as tactical, technical, strength and health. Choosing a selection of characters that target the mission goals can make the gameplay much easier. At the destination, the player has individual access to each character and their inventory. The phaser, tricorder, and various specialized devices (such as medical equipment) are used in the game to interact with the environment.

In-game events are played out through conversations on the main bridge viewscreen, in-person on away missions, and via short in-game animated cinematics. The game's intro mimics the intro of television series.

Gameplay:

The game has three different settings.

Bridge- Various interface stations allow the player to navigate, start away missions, and access the password system which can be used to play saved games at different points of the game.

Combat- Should an enemy attack the Enterprise D, the red alert klaxons go off and the visual is transferred to a tatical grid that shows the Enterprise and the attacking ship. The player may fire phasers and photon torpedoes while maneuvering. Damage sustained during these battles can either be repaired at the Engineering console on the bridge, or at one of the three starbases in the sector. Damage inflicted can affect various systems, such as being unable to beam down to away missions, unable to access navigation, blurred and garbled communications, or ship destruction.

Away Mission- The player controls four members of an away team. The player can control each one in turn by switching to the respective portrait. Certain characters have different abilities based on their service branch.

Tips:

Level Select
When the Star Trek Logo appears, press Y, Y, X, X, A, A, B, B. Then, when you begin the game, pause the game and press Y.

Weapons can also be acquired but only used by certain characters. Depending on the difficulty setting, the game's ending scene also features different music in which the Stone Protectors are seen performing as a band.

The game has received moderately positive critiques in terms of crisp graphics, pleasant music, and accurate collision detection. One the other hand, Stone Protectors' plot and the repetitive nature of beat 'em up titles has led to criticisms of blandness. In December 1994, GamePro gave Stone Protectors a 3.5 out of 5 rating.

If you think that this is a mix between Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, you're dead wrong. Here's how the game works. When you start, you can choose from two fighters...I mean one fighter with two sets of clothing. After that, the game starts. It's the usual "win two rounds and proceed" fare. You don't get the controls found in most fighting games, which really sucks. Instead, they are more like a brawler. The funny thing about this game is when you hold the arrow keys or D-pad in a upper corner while pressing the kick button, the character hovers and puts one of his feet way up in the air. Here are the rest of my thoughts. The game is worse than I expected. I can't even play as my opponents, which really makes me mad. Remember, don't expect Chun-Li to perform her Level 3 combo on Liu Kang in Street Combat. One more thing: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME!!

Directions:

Like in most fighting games, beat all your opponents one at a time. 

Controls:

A Button = Special
B Button - Kick
X Button - Jump
Y Button - Punch
L Button - Block
R Button - Block
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Select Menu Items

Street Fighter Alpha 2 retains most of the new features introduced in the original Street Fighter Alpha, such as the three-level Super Combo gauge, Alpha Counters, Air-Blocking and Fall Breaking. The main new feature in the game is the inclusion of the "Custom Combo" system ("Original Combo" in Japan), which replaces the "Chain Combos" from the first Alpha. If the Super Combo gauge is on Lv. 1 or above, the player can initiate a Custom Combo pressing two punch buttons and a kick simultaneously (or vice versa). The player can then perform any series of basic and special moves to create a Custom Combo until the Timer Gauge at the bottom of the screen runs out. The only characters that can still perform Chain Combos in the game are Guy and Gen, but only to a limited extent. Additionally, each character now has two Alpha Counters instead of just one: one that can be performed with a kick button and another with a punch button.

The single-player mode, much like the original Street Fighter Alpha, consist of eight matches with computer-controlled opponents, including a fixed final opponent whose identity depends on the player's selected character. Each character also has a secret "rival" whom they can face during the course of the single-player mode after meeting certain requirements, in which then the rival will interrupt one of the player's regularly scheduled matches and exchange dialogue with the player's character. With Akuma now a regular character, a more powerful version of the character dubbed "Shin Akuma" replaces him as a secret opponent. Unlike Super Turbo and the original Alpha, Shin Akuma challenges the player before the player's final opponent, rather than as an alternate final boss.

Tips:

Australia Stage
Go to versus mode and put the cursor on Sagat. Then hold: Start for five seconds. Finally press any button.

Chun-li's hidden costume
On the select screen, move to Chun-li and hold Start then press any other button to select her.

Get Alternate Costumes
While selecting a character quickly press: L, Y, B

Fight against Shin Akuma
Beat the game without losing a round with 5 or more perfect victories or using a continue.

THE TOURNAMENT BEGINS

Twelve fighters from across the globe have come together to face one another to see which of them has the strength, skill and courage to be crowned champion. Each fighter has mastered different skills and special moves, but it will take more than brute strength to defeat the others and earn the title of Grand Master.

--From the SNES Street Fighter 2 Turbo instruction manual.

Overview:

Street Fighter 2 Turbo is almost just like Street Fighter 2. The only difference is, you can adjust the speed of the game-play. The Street Fighter series is one of the most popular in the fighting game genre. In it's day, it was only matched by Mortal Kombat. Street Fighter 2 Turbo is a lot of fun, so give it a try!

Directions:

Use your martial art skills to defeat your opponent. 

Controls:

A Button - Med. Kick
B Button - Fast Kick
X Button - Med. Punch
Y Button - Quick Punch
L Button - Fierce Punch
R Button - Fierce Kick
Start Button - Start/Pause

Toggle Special Moves On/Off on VS. Battle mode

Game Posters and Extra Ending
Finish a one player game against the computer at level 8 difficulty without continuing.

After the normal ending, instead of the characters battling credits you normally get for defeating the game at level 6 or higher, you get a sequence for each character, similar to the character stats at the game menu screen, using a move to destroy a crate.

Once the credits have rolled, a poster will appear on the screen. For Turbo it is a group shot of all eight player characters, for Normal (Champion Edition) it is a picture or Ryu and M. Bison.

Skip 1-Player Matches
Not really a cheat but a useful trick none thr less. begin a 1 player game as usual but during the game press start on controller two so that player two joins in , choose player 2's character , say for example Ryu , and then defeat him.

Once the two player game ends you will be taken back to the one-player tournament , now the character you defeated during the two player round will be checked off and you will not have to fight him in tournament mode.

Using this trick the only character you will have to beat to complete the game is M. bison.

Eight fighters from across the globe have come together to see which of them has the strength, skill and courage to challenge the mysterious Grand Masters. Each fighter has different skills and special moves, but it will take more than brute strength to earn the title of World Warrior.
--from the SNES Street Fighter II instruction manual

Major Bison is holding a tournament for the greatest fighter in the world. With each character, they all have their own unique story! So whether you're Ryu, Blanka, Ken or whoever, you better be ready for some intense street fighting action!

Directions:

There are 8 fighters to choose from: Blanka, Chun Li, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Ken, Ryu, and Zangief. Each has their own special move, so use any type of button combo to find them out! And with three different types of punches and kicks, you can't go wrong!

There are two modes of play:
In "Game Start", you and you alone go around the world, fighting other fighters to win.
In "V.S. Battle", you and another player face off! 

Controls:

A Button - Mid Kick
B Button - Low Kick
X Button - Mid Punch
Y Button - Low Punch
L Button - High Punch
R Button - High Kick
Start Button - Make selections, pause/unpause
Select Button - Switch between options at title menu (control pad can also be used)

Tips:

Remove Energy Bars, Timers, and Sound
Go into the Options menu and press Start to return to the main menu. Repeat this process 27 times.

Same character in VS. Mode
Press Down, R, Up, L, Y, B at the Capcom logo.

Pass-by Opponents
In order to do this, you'll need to have a 'second player' and as 'Player 2' chooses his/her character (i. e. you choosing the character as 'Player 2's' character will be nothing more than a punching bag); you need to choose the character you're stuck on (which could be Chun Li, Honda E. or anybody else) and as you defeat that character that 'Player 2' is controlling; you'll realize that the computer will take you to the next character.  Note: You cannot do this when fighting M. Bison, Vega or any other character that is not available to be chosen when playing the game.

Configuration Screen
Hold the Select button while the world map is on the screen before a match begins. You will be able to change your controller configuration.

Extra endings
To get better endings, beat the game at the highest difficulty. Each character has a different ending, so you can have 8 different endings!

Extra Sounds
To listen to extra sounds on 1f to 23 on the Option Screen, go to sound 25, 26, or 27. Then rapidly press the R button. The new sounds should be there.

Get Full Character Profiles

Street Hockey '95
Platform: Super NES

_________________________

Street Hockey '95 is a roller hockey game for the Super NES that takes place in an urban environment. Instead of ice, the players play on cement and instead of ice skates, they use rollerblades. Players assemble their squads from nine hockey players who are savvy in the ways of the street. There are six different kinds of urban arenas and five different variations on the "traditional" road hockey game. Street Hockey '95 uses more than two thousand frames of digitized animation; making it relatively advanced for its era.

Street Racer
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Racing
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Vivid Image
Publisher: Ubisoft
_________________________
*
The game features the ability to race the Street Racer Championship, beginning with the Bronze Championship and moving on to the Silver Championship, Gold Championship and Platinum Championship. Each championship gave you, after winning, a new password which could be entered on the Options Screen in order to unlock new tracks. The winner of the championship would be the driver with the most points after every race has been completed. Points are awarded according to the final positioning of each race, with bonus points awarded to the driver with the most punches, the most stars collected, the fastest lap, a record lap and drivers who lapped other drivers. The Championship could be raced in Championship, Head-to-head or Practice mode.

The game also featured the ability to choose the tracks for a Custom Championship, to drive a head-to-head series with a CPU driver, and to drive individual practice races. There was also a racing game called "Rumble", the objective being to knock the drivers out of a ring. It could be played in 3 levels of difficulty. Also, a "Soccer" mode (not in the Playstation version) featured a field to play against all other characters, with a giant soccer ball and a single goal for all. The score wasn't of team play though.

For all modes of play, whether Championship, Custom Championship, Rumble, or Soccer, Street Racer allowed the setting of many of the game parameters.

Tips:

Car Mods
At the Driver Select screen, press X, Y, X, Y, X, Y, and HOLD X. While holding X, use the d-pad to change your driver's stats.

Extra Tracks (Custom Cup Tracks 21-24)
Go to the Option screen and select Custom Cup Setup. When the screen appears, press L, R, L, R, X, Y.

In the last years of the 20th century, the nations of the world have united to dismantle their massive arsenals of nuclear doom. With the promise of permanent world peace finally at hand, only a madman would still harbor dreams of world domination. Such a madman is the dictator of Sovinia, a small but cunning rebel nation.

In his insane lust for power, he has joined forces with a huge, hostile war force from beyond this planet, armed with weapons more powerful than anything ever seen before by man. The Allied Countries of Earth try to resist, but without nuclear weapons, their efforts are futile. By 2008, most of the planet lies in ruins; then, in an ironic twist of treachery, the alien forces turn against their ally, and set out to complete their conquest and colonization of Earth

Now, with the survival of the human race at stake, the allied countries join forces with the rebel dictatorship in a last-ditch effort to drive out the invaders. At their secret fortress deep in the Amazon Jungle, the greatest scientists of Earth carefully analyze the alien weaponry, and develop the weapon to end all weapons: Strike Gunner. With time running out, and few resources remaining, only two can be built; but those two can combine at will into one superfighter of astonishing power. With an awesome arsenal of offensive and defensive devices at your command, and your own unmatched courage and skill as a fighter pilot, the Earth may yet be saved.

~From the Manual

Gameplay:

The player goes through various levels and stages, usually based around certain environmental elements such as snow or desert, and faces numerous types of enemies. The levels feature wave after wave of normal enemies ranging from helicopters to turrets that usually only require one or two hits to destroy. At various points in each level, the player faces a boss vehicle, such as a giant airship or an enormous desert tank. At certain points, a stealth bomber (or in later levels, a space shuttle or capsule) will appear to airdrop the player laser power-ups, recharge special weapons, or give a speed boost.

Using the Strike Gunner, the player is armed with a dual red laser weapon that can be upgraded several times to a more powerful blue laser. In addition to this weapon, the player chooses a second, more powerful "special weapon" with a limited charge before they begin the mission. There are 15 advanced weapons to pick from such as the devastating MegaBeam Cannon or AntiAir Mines (see below for a complete list). This allows for a strategic approach to the game because certain weapons are more effective on certain missions. The "special weapon" has various limitations, depending on which one is being used; for example, the MegaBeam Cannon is extremely powerful, but only lasts less five seconds and can only be used once per charge.

The game supports two players as well, with two Strike Gunners (Player 1 is Jane, red, and Player 2 is Mark, blue) facing the same missions as single player. This adds another layer of strategy to the game because each player can choose their own "special weapons" and utilize a deadly combination of timed special attacks. Players can link their aircraft in two different ways by pressing the X or Y button.

Stunt Race FX
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Racing , Cars
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Nintendo
Publisher: Nintendo
_________________________
*
Stunt Race FX appears to be like a zany version of SEGA's Virtua Racing. The gameplay differs from Nintendo's own Super Mario Kart by being somewhat more difficult and through the lack of weapons to use to attack other vehicles in the game. Similarities with Nintendo's F-Zero include the ability to boost the speed of the vehicles, the use of the L and R buttons to make sharper turns, and the possibility of damaging vehicles by running into walls, hazards, or other vehicles; falling damage is also possible.

Graphics:

The capabilities of the Super FX chip are demonstrated extensively in Stunt Race FX. Each course appears to be constructed with 3D polygons, complete with road bumps and overhead passes, resulting in a considerably large number of animation screens. Detailed billboard advertisements also appear throughout each race course. These realistic representations were possible on the Super NES because the Super FX chip rendered 2D sprites in a visual format that resembled 3D polygons. Under this format, polygons would not "crash" together to become distorted, though the graphics would run slower. This lack of speed was incorporated into the gameplay by featuring cars that were heavier and clumsier than those included in conventional racing games.

Since polygons would not crash together under the FX graphics chip, it became impossible to depict cars crashing into water or being submerged in water. In courses with lakes or rivers, where it is possible for the player to run off the race course into the water, the player's vehicle automatically veers off-screen when the vehicle is about to enter a body of water. The game screen then fades-out to return to another camera angle.

Tips:

Reset memory
At the title screen when it says 'Push Start', press Up, left, down, right, X, Y, B, A

Toggle Views
Pause the game and press Select. The car that's in the pause animation will now go backward. Now press L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R.

Unlockables

2WD (Dirt Bike) 
Beat Speed Trax on the Master difficulty

Radio Control Option 
Get a perfect on all of the stunt courses (Get  all 40 stars)

Master Class 
Beat speed trax on novice and expert.

Arwing in Night Owl
In the Night Owl stage, there should be four small 'StarFox' signs on the walls of the course, that fall if you crash into them. Ram all four signs, and an Arwing from Star Fox will fly in and drop a power-up.

Control the animation when the game is paused Pause the game and when the pause animation comes up, press R to make the animation run in slow motion. Press Y to speed up the car in the animation, or press Select to make it run backwards.

One-Player Battle Trax
To play battle Trax alone, select Battle Trax made and cars for both players. After the green light, wait about two seconds before hitting the gas. Any vehicle not activated by a controller will be driven by the CPU.

Genre: Action , Side-Scrolling
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Konami

_________________________

Sunset Riders for the SNES is better than the version for Genesis for many reasons, and I hope to give you dozens why!

Sunset Riders is a classic run'n'gun shooter by Konami, creators of other such games such as the most popular example Contra. The SNES version is as faithful as you can get to the Arcade version, although Nintendo did censor it a little bit. The game-play remains strong and as addictive as it was in Arcades, and no major elements are removed.

Sure, Clint Eastwood might not be a playable character, but you'll still feel drawn into this fast paced Wild Wild West world! Konami did some great work bringing every piece of what it means to be a Cowboy together! You'll shoot your way through 8 stages of tough, bullet dodging, speedy madness as either Steve, Billy, Bob, or Cormano, all four Western bounty hunters out for blood, money, and women. Each of the four characters are slightly different. Steve and Billy use revolvers which are fast, but require a bit of accuracy. Bob and Cormano use shotguns requiring less accuracy, but are therefore slower.

Dash through 8 stages of bliss, receiving power-ups from barflies and dead enemies as you fight your way to claiming your reward. Take time to perfect your timing and aim, and you'll be blazing through this western game in no time at all. Have fun jumping to balconies to shoot enemies or shoot dynamite to blow them off the screen! Keep your eyes peeled and be sure to see every bullet and its trajectory, moving accordingly to save your life but take theirs. Move through each invigorating stage, getting closer and closer to eliminating the big boss and claiming all the gold and the maiden!

I cannot stress how solid this game is for a 1991 shooter, especially coming off the heels of Contra. This game is a great stand-alone shooter that was mainly overlooked for its cowboy theme. Rumor was they were making a pirate one next, but it never came to see the light of day since Sunset Riders never took off as they anticipated. The controls in this game are solid and tight and you have a much higher precision shooting than in most other shooters. The Genesis version was addicting, but misses some of the best aspects, especially levels and characters, each cut in half! The sound and graphics aren't on par with their Arcade counterparts either! If you haven't played Sunset Riders or played the Genesis instead, you have sorely missed out and should play now. If I had to bring about one bad thing the SNES version lacked, it was 4 player or the fact that the controller at the time was miserable for control, but now that shouldn't be a problem! 

Still remaining two players and insanely fun, bring a friend for the ride!

Sunset Riders shoots up an 8 out of 10!

Directions:

Shoot, slide, ride, and jump your way into becoming rich, through tough bosses with bounties on their head. Choose one of the four characters (Steve, Billy, Bob, and Cormano) and let loose on the baddies disturbing the Wild West.

Fierce accuracy is almost required throughout the game, especially if you make it beyond stages 3 or 4.

This is great and adds to the determination you will have to want to master the game's 8-directional shooting as well as sliding to dodge bullets and take out your enemies in a safer proximity. Though jumping is not as prominent as in other Konami shooters, your players can pull off some rather amazing leaps on to rooftops and ledges, and jump between moving train cars. Beware though, enemies will follow, so use levels to your advantage quickly!

As you progress through the stages, you will find new enemies that present an ever-increasing danger! Some will have dynamite ready to blow you up, others will be fast with the draw, and some will offer you power-ups if you manage to take them down. To make it a fair fight, enter bars, a barmaid will wave you goodbye and you gain a power-up. You will either receive:
Rapid Fire - Golden badge that makes whichever character's weapon, much faster!
Dual-Wield -Silver Badge, that allows you to carry two weapons firing it about a 45 degree angle!
1-Up - A 1up symbol for extra life
And sometimes just a coin to increase your score!

Each stage, like all other games, ends with a boss, and each boss has a money reward that you will receive for killing them. Be careful, each boss gets increasingly difficult and painful. As you reach the end, bosses will become so infuriating you're likely to get a headache if you're not at the proper skill level! The monetary reward is much like score points in MegaMan when you select a boss. Each level varies widely, throwing you in many different parts of a Wild Wild West and placing you right in the middle of the action that never stops. This aspect of the game will keep your heart racing and your mind eager to see the next stage. As I said, you get to play many parts of the cowboy role, gunning, running, and even Riding?! Make it to stage 2 and enjoy the thrill of riding horseback, taking out the enemies on the train! You'll fight in towns big and small, saloons, on trains, Indian mountain territory, a forest and finally the Big Boss's Territory! 

Every once in a while you will also get a bonus stage to increase your score wildly!

Bring a friend in the adventure and fight over whose gold is whose and which girl will be yours! 

Controls:

A Button - Slide (While Moving)
B Button - Jump (hold to jump from/to balconies)
X Button - N/A
Y Button - Fire

Select Button - N/A

Tips:

Advance directly to final level
Enter the 'Options' screen and use the d-pad to enter the code 
Left, Left, Left, Up, Up, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right

Extra Continues
Start a one player game. When you run out of continues, before your last man dies, press START on controller 2 so you can play as Player 2 with a full set of continues!

Play as same character
Start a game with player one then get yourself killed.  Continue on the game over screen with player two and
select the same character as player one did.  During gameplay press start on controller one and player one will join as the same character.

After a glorious wedding, Master Higgins and his pretty wife, Tina, were on their way to a romantic honeymoon. But from out of nowhere, a tropical cyclone broke through the seas and ripped the newlyweds apart. Tina survived but lay dazed on the island of Waku-Waku. Her memory had completely vanished.

Master Higgins had an equally rough time, being bounced around and drifting aimlessly before finally landing on a deserted island. Master lost his memory as well, his vision of Tina all but a grain of sand on the vast beach before him. But being a great warrior, he set out to recover his past.

Tina was found and came to live on the island of Waku-Waku. The good king there soon fell in love with her and they decided to marry. But trouble was in the air! Just as the King was about to slip on the ring...

From towering heights came a beastly buzzard. Swooping down, he stole Tina from the altar and carried her off. While Master Higgins was passing the castle, he heard the screaming Tina, not recognizing the voice of his lost, fair maiden.

Super Alfred Chicken
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Twilight Games
Publisher: Mindscape
_________________________
*
The player takes the role of a chicken named Alfred who must find his way through bizarre levels full of balloons, telephones, cheese and other strange elements. While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time.

To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked.

Alfred can receive a few powerups during the game. For one power up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make a giant flower give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting things and hurting enemies. Another power up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. You must find a can of worms to get this power up.

The music in Alfred Chicken is usually upbeat and silly. Mixed with the gameplay and characters, the overall feel of the game can be described as similar.

Tips:

Scene Select
In the title screen, press Select, then Start to bring up the configuration screen. On the second controller keep pressed A, X, L, R while pressing Start on the first controller. Now the scene selection screen should appear.

Level Passwords:
From the title screen, go to 'Start', then 'Use Password'.

Moon-Star-Balloon-1UP-2UP Stage 15
Alfred-2Up-Star-Moon-1UP Stage 8

Warp up to level 6
Locate the giant sunflower balloon in level 1. Get to the right side of the screen without releasing the balloon. Once touching the right wall, jump straight up to find a hidden block. Use the block to jump left off the screen, then walk left to find the warp.

Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. 

Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.

The game is the sixth overall installment of the Bases Loaded series, and third installment of the secondary trilogy for the Super Nintendo. The series spanned three generations of consoles and eight total installments. The original Bases Loaded title was an arcade game that Jaleco ported to the NES. There was also a Game Boy version of Bases Loaded. Only the original Bases Loaded was an aracade game; the rest of the series were exclusive to their particular consoles. There are four video games in the Bases Loaded NES series, Bases Loaded II: Second Season, Bases Loaded 3 and Bases Loaded 4. The series continued onto the SNES platform with Super Bases Loaded, Super Bases Loaded 2, and Super Bases Loaded 3. The final entry to the series was Bases Loaded '96: Double Header, released for the fifth generation consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.

This installment is notable for being the first game in the series to use real players and teams. The game was licensed by Major League Baseball, and includes a roster of real-life players and teams.

Gameplay:

For many aspects of gameplay, such as fielding and base-running, the game offers players a choice between automatic and manual control. For example, a player who opts for manual control of his team's fielders will, when catching a fly ball, have to move the fielder of his choice into position to make the catch. Unfortunately, due to a flaw in the scrolling system used during plays, the fielding team's outfielders are often offscreen, often making it extremely difficult to successfully complete a play in manual mode.

The game has also been criticized for the audio samples used to voice its umpire, characterized by some as incongruous and/or inappropriately effete. In particular, the samples used when calling strikes (and strikeouts) have been likened to the Yes Guy (a character from The Simpsons, who was in turn based on a character created by Frank Nelson).

One major flaw in the game is that one pitch, the split-finger fastball, cannot be hit if it is thrown high in the strike zone. A perfect game with 27 strikeouts can be thrown at will by using only this pitch. Only a handful of pitchers in the game can throw the pitch, however.

The final entry to the series was Bases Loaded '96: Double Header, released for the fifth generation consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.

Gameplay:

The battery backup allowed players to save several categories of statistics for all 14 teams in the two leagues and not just their own. The DSP chip allowed a rudimentary 3-D perspective for batting and sometimes infield play. When players swung, their own individual numbers appeared on the back of their jerseys.

There were seven teams each in the "Alpha League" and the "Omega League" that went by city names only, and often borrowed symbols from those of the original Super Bases Loaded. The nicknames in quotation marks are those of the original SBL teams for whom the symbols were based, but do not appear in the game. The Alpha League consisted of the Boston "Kings," the Chicago "Lizards," the Cleveland "Stars," the Detroit "Storm," the Kansas City "Tornadoes", Oakland, and Seattle. The Omega League consisted of the Atlanta "Weasels," Houston, the Los Angeles "Cyclops," the New York "Mercs," Philadelphia, the Pittsburgh "Buzzards," and the San Francisco "Amoebas."

In addition, there were four edit teams: Urbana, Rockford, Peoria, and Aurora.

In this sequel to Super Battletank, the player takes control of the feared M1A2 Battletank in 16 missions centered in the Middle East. After they are attacked by an unknown group of enemies on both land and air, the player is tasked to root out these enemies and stop any further attacks on Coalition forces.

Much like its predecessor, the gameplay is a first-person tank simulation, using radar to scout out enemy tanks and using the main turret gun to disable and kill any opposing tanks, jeeps, APCs and various other heavy weapons including SCUD missiles. If the player encounters and air resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine gun to cut down enemy choppers.

Players also have smoke screens that can temporarily make them unseen to any enemy forces, plus they can call in supply drops to replenish their armor and ammo as well as air support that can level any opposing force in their wake.

Take control of an M1A1 Battle Tank on the front lines of the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, and you are a tank commander of the coalition forces sent to stop him in his tracks. Your mission is to send Hussein's troops scurrying home like bugs. Take out enemy tanks, helicopters, and SCUD missile launchers, in order to stop Hussein's invasion and prevent further casualties to your allies.

Tips:

Super Battletank

Move around Faster
Instead of moving at the slow, normal pace, switch the screen to map mode, and drive your tank from there to get around a lot faster.

Super Machine Gun
Fire you machine guns at a target, and as the bullets are hitting the target, pause the game. If the object is red when you pause the game, the bullets will keep hitting the target and destroying it without costing you bullets, or your tank.

Super Black Bass is the second game in the Black Bass series. The original was a lot of fun and this one is too. Super Black Bass added some pretty cool features. The graphics and sound were a lot better, and they added some new lures and a fish finder. I could spend all day playing this game trying to catch that ever elusive 12-15 pound bass. You will play through a series of tournements trying to get the highest weight in bass in order to place well in the tournement. What the bass will bite depends on the weather. If you push X, the game will give you some hints on what to fish with. Super Black Bass is a lot of fun, so if you are a fan of fishing, give this game a try!

Catch the biggest bass you can find to win the tournement.

Five evil cyborgs, called the "Five Dastardly Bombers" are bent on taking over the universe. At the planet Earth, they capture the original Bomberman, and he is placed a prison cell in their base. He awakens in the dungeon of Magnet Bomber and must fight his way to a final showdown with the Magnet Bomber himself. In the following four levels, Bomberman will challenge Golem Bomber, Pretty Bomber, Brain Bomber, and their leader, Plasma Bomber in an effort to free the Earth of these alien invaders as well as save himself.

Gameplay:

The gameplay consists of walking through maze-like areas filled with monsters with a goal of opening the gate leading to the next area. Playing as a bomberman, the player can lay bombs to destroy all of the monsters, which will subsequently open the gate. Destroying blocks in the maze may uncover useful items including remote control bombs, accelerators, and hearts. There are five levels total and at the end of each is a boss. Each boss is faced first alone in an arena until he or she has been defeated. The boss then retreats back to another arena where the play will face him or her in a personalized machine. After the boss is defeated, the player will continue to the next level.

Multiplayer:

In Battle Mode, one to four players can face off against one another in one of ten arenas designed specifically for multiplayer play. Matches can be customized as battle royal matches or as team matches. Besides the regular items found in singleplayer mode, the glove (allowing Bomberman to pick up and toss bombs) and speed increases can be found in multiplayer. A special option called G-Bomber can also be enabled allowing the winner of each match to be given a special item to begin the next match with and also to be colored golden.

This game scales back a lot of gameplay additions made in Super Bomberman 2 and returns to the classic formula. As for multiplayer, the game adds a lot over the previous game by adding more characters, each representing a country of Earth (including one of the villains, Pretty Bomber, as France, which marks her first appearance as a non-enemy character). There are also new cutscenes for the Story mode, which centers around the resurrection of the Five Dastardly Bombers who were previously defeated in Super Bomberman 2, as Shirobon and Kurobon adventure across various element themed stars in which the Five are causing havoc, under the rule of their creator, Bagular. Super Bomberman 3 is also the first game in the Super Bomberman series to feature Louies, which would become frequent in the next installments.

The overall animation graphics changed with the 3rd installment; unlike Super Bomberman 1 and 2, the 3rd sequel's graphics were simplified, which look similar to the graphics of the old PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 Bomberman games, and most of the music in the game are remixed versions of previous older Bomberman soundtracks.

Boss Character Passwords: for Configuration Battle Mode
Well, through the cunning use of patch codes, I have been able to make near-exact duplicates of each and every boss character in Configuration Battle Mode. They can't take as many hits as they can in Single Player Mode due to how Configuration Battle Mode works, and certain characters' unique powers might be diminished slightly due to how Battle Mode works in general(IE, Bomber Woof can't lay more than one Land Mine Bomb at a time, Baron Bombano can't scatter Skulls and Geta about, etc.). . .and their colors aren't 100% precise. . .but the Items, Fire, Bomb Up, and Speed Up statuses are perfectly accurate. Check 'em out.

Mokushiroku no Bomberman'
Notes: This is a warped creation of mine. He's basically the same old Bomberman you'd have by the end of a Single Player session, but he has not the maximum of 8 Bomb Ups, Fires, and Speed Ups, but a total of 9 of each, and also has each and every obtainable item aside from the Bomb Kick and Pursuing Bomb items! As far as I can tell, however, the Land Mine Bombs override the Remote Controlled Bombs.('Mokushiroku no Bomberman' translates to 'Bomberman of the Apocalypse, ' for anyone who cares.)

'Subordinate Bomber' 
Notes: The Subordinate Bomber works perfectly fine in battle games, but keep in mind.  Playing with him will result in some odd(but completely harmless) graphical glitches on the Win Counter in-game and possibly the battlefield. He has no victory sound name-sound.(Like when playing a Single Match and Dave Bomber wins, you'd hear 'Deibu
Bondaa' during the Victory screen.) This, of course, makes the game crash, seeing as it can't find the sound it wants to play. He's entirely safe to use in Tag Matches, though. Finally, his stats come from when you've destroyed Pirate Bomber before him. He gets a boost from 2 Fires to 8 Fires. Nothing more.

Subordinate Bomber 2YLPVD
Bomber Woof AFK4VH
Mokushiroku no Bomberman BXMBJJ
Baron Bombano CP6NVN
Muscle Bomber EU0PLE
Plunder Bomber KT3MT5
Gary Bomber QN3PDU
Dave Bomber RNHPC2
Iron Mask Bomber WN6XCH
Pirate Bomber YK1PLG

Configure Cheat
In the Configure Option in the Battle Mode, Input 23D830 as a password to acquire the following:  The character you get is a red Subordinate Bomber (The guy that helps Pirate Bomber when you fight him as a boss.) who isn't normally playable. On his stats screen, his Bomb and Speed levels are at 8, The number that tells the level of his firepower is screwed up (Changing it will mess up your screen), he'll have all of the special items (I. E. Kick, Punch, Throw, Wall Passer, etc.), and he'll still have 98 build points left! Save him, and he'll be shown on the character select screen as a red X and his face is a red Bomberman because Hudson Soft didn't create a face of him. Playing as him will often cause weird, messed up sprites to appear on screen.

_________________________

The fourth game in the regular "Bonk" caveman series, Bonk is back on his first Super Nintendo outing.

In this side-scrolling platformer adventure, the gameplay is similar to Bonk 3. Super Bonk allows Bonk to travel through time from his prehistoric levels, the insides of a dinosaur, a version of modern Chinatown, and even the moon! Along the way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a dinosaur form called "Big Kronk", find candies that change his size from tiny to huge, travel through transportation tubes, and find multiple bonus levels.

Bonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!

Bonk originally appeared on the PC-Engine and was actually sort of the console's mascot character for a while. But then the console died, and poor Bonk had to look for other employment opportunities. So he got to star in two SNES Bonk games, the first of which was brought over to the US.

In this game, you guide Bonk through various levels, collecting items and beating bosses by using your head, and I don't mean thinking. You use a headbutt to beat up your enemies, or you jump and dive at them using your head.

Additionally, you can also grab meat, which makes Bonk change into other? personalities. I've got Pissed-Off Bonk and Femenine Bonk so far. And I wish I was joking in regards to that second one. The game's fairly simple, and easy to play. Just don't let it go to your head. Oh, I'm here all week folks, thank you!

Translation Description:

All the essential text has been hacked and translated in by Musashi. However, there were some compressed graphic text that he couldn't mess with, like the signs and stuff. Nothing big, and you can play the game without it. So go play!

The object of the game is to use your gun to pop bubbles that bounce around your screen. There are two different modes in this game: Panic Mode or Arcade Mode. When a player pops a bubble, it splits into two smaller bubbles. This happens repeatedly, but eventually, the bubbles get so small that they pop when shot. Occasionally, monsters will walk or fly on to the screen, these can be seen as a help or harm to the player. When the player touches a monster, they die, but monsters can pop bubbles. This is the next part of super pang with added stages. Although the Super Buster Bros. arcade game allowed two players to play simultaneously, the Super Nintendo version has only one player mode.

EVIL LURKS IN THE DARKNESS

In the small country of Transylvania there is a legend which says that every 100 years the forces of Good mysteriously become weak and the forces of Evil gain a foothold into our world. The evil manifests itself in the form of one of the most feared characters to roam the earth -- the vampire Dracula!

Every 100 years Dracula is revived and grows stronger and stronger. His goal is to turn all humanity into creatures of darkness, to be ruled under his iron first. He has appeared in this world many times, and there are many people who fear that in his next appearance, he may be unstoppable.

There is one group that has always been around to see that Dracula is defeated, the Belmont family. For generations the Belmonts have passed along the secrets and skills of vampire-hunting to the eldest child of the family. While many of the Belmonts have lived peaceful lives without encountering Dracula, they remain prepared. There are occasional skirmishes with lesser monsters, but the Belmont clan has always emerged victorious.

Now, 100 years have passed since the last battle between Dracula and the Belmonts. Transylvanians are reporting mysterious sightings of odd creatures appearing under the cover of darkness. As Spring approaches, the citizens prepare for a traditional celebration.

Unbeknownst to them, an evil group of people is holding a ceremony in the old destroyed abbey outside of the town, attempting to revive the Prince of Darkness. As they carry out their ritual a dark cloud descends over the countryside. The sinister group stirs itself into a frenzy of mysterious chanting and pagan dancing, then lightning strikes the abbey. The ground bucks under their feet, and the abbey walls shudder. Once again, Dracula is revived!

It is time once again for Simon Belmont to call forth the powers of good to aid him in his battle. Armed with his mystical whip, his courage and the centuries-old knowledge of Belmont family training, he sets forth on his mission...

--From the SNES Castlevania 4: Super Castlevania instruction manual.

Overview:

Castlevania has always been one of Konami's biggest series. Castlevania 4 was an excellent addition, one of the best, in my humble opinion. The graphics were well rendered and brightly colored. The sounds were upgraded with just enough of the original score to remind you of the good old days. The controls were a lot better, with the ability to throw your whip in any direction and the secondary weapon getting its own button. The gameplay stuck to the original side-scrolling asdventure formula, which was a treat to Castlevania fans everywhere. Be sure to give this monumental addition to the series a try.

Directions:

Castlevania 4 laid down a lot of firsts for the Castlevania series. For instance, this was the first Castlevania to feature the ability to throw your whip in any direction. It was also the first to feature the ability to use your whip as a swing like Indiana Jones.

Since the SNES had a controller with more buttons, it also debuted a separate button for the secondary weapon, which eliminated the "random axe being thrown while walking up the stairs" aggravation. Castlevania 4 was also the first to feature the ability to change the direction Belmont is looking in mid-air. Speaking of jumping, this was also the first game in the series to allow you to jump on to a staircase. Throw in the ability to crouch walk, the ability to hold your whip out in front of you like a shield, and a "true to the Castlevania series" theme, and you've got yourself a great game!

These tasty additions were the only real difference in gameplay from the first and third games. Power-up items are found in candles and include: whip upgrade- turns your whip from leather to chain the first time, and makes it longer the second; small heart- one heart; large heart- five hearts; leg roast- refills half of your life; whole roast- refills all your life; double shot- allows you to throw two secondary weapons; triple shot- allows you to throw three secondary weapons; rosary- destroys all enemies on a screen; potion- makes you temporarily invincible; bag of gold- extra points.

You will also find the secondary weapons in candles. The dagger flies straight and only costs one heart to use, but it is weak. The axe is powerful and only costs one heart, but it flies in an arc so it's hard to hit with sometimes. The holy water costs only one heart and is thrown on the floor: it creates a little fire when it breaks that enemies will walk into for multiple hits. Its only downfall is short distance. The boomerang will fly straight and return to you for another pass at enemies. It does good damage and only costs one heart. The stopwatch will stop all enemies for a few seconds, but it costs five hearts to use.

Just like parts one and three, you will have a boss at the end of each level. You will get an orb for beating him, your life will be refilled, points will be tallied, and you will move on to the next level. 

Controls:

A Button - None
B Button - Jump
X Button - None
Y Button - Whip
L Button - None
R Button - Secondary Weapon
Start Button - Start/Pause
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Full Arsenal
In the last stage, before you climb the stairs to Dracula, jump down to the left. You will land on an invisible platform. Move all the way to the left of the screen and you will get full health, 99 hearts, a cross, a full upgraded whip, and a triple shot.

invisible platform. Move all the way to the left of the screen and you will get full health, 99 hearts, a cross, a full upgraded whip, and a III stone.

Three Hidden Routes
There are three hidden branches from the main path in this game.

The first one is in stage 3-1. There will be a point where you must descend a short vertical shaft. Halfway
down here is a wall of pillars to the left. These can easily be demolished, where you will find a small side room containing hearts, cash bags, and some Roast.

The second secret, which is an actual hidden Block, is in stage 6-2. At the very beginning you'll need to pass a hallway with Axe Knights and falling chandeliers. The third archway has a chandelier but no guard. Hit the floor a couple of times and it'll crumble, revealing a stairwell into a secret area.

The last one is in Block 9-2. The third section has you jump across a bed of spikes at the beginning. After this you'll see several whirlwind tunnels and some coffins. The last upper platform on the right has a coffin and a tunnel. Let the tunnel suck you in and you'll find a hidden area full of bonuses.

_________________________

Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.

But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.

Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal, they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.

When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.

Super Conflict is a military simulation game played on a hex map in which players try to capture the opponent's "Flag Tank" or "Flag Ship". The map consists of various terrain tiles with movement and defense modifiers. For example, bridges and deserts lower the defense ratings of occupying troops; hills and mountains provide additional defenses but require more fuel to move through. There are over 55 different scenarios and 16 two-player scenarios.

Tips:

Change computer's weapon
Before the attack animation is played out, keep pressing the B button on controller 2.

Mission Select
At the scenario map hold L + B+X + Y, let go of X, hold it again, release them all and move the jeep up to the unit area. Press L + B.

Unlimited Ammo for Heavy Weapons
Switch your weapon after you've fired and you will hit with the weapon you switched to and not the one you fired.
When you are going to attack, fire your weaker weapon (which has unlimited ammo) and switch to your heavy weapon (which as limited ammo). NO ammo will be used by the heavy weapon: this glitch lets it have Unlimited ammo as long as you switch to it from the weaker weapon every time you attack.

The first version of Demo World was released on September 10, 2001. While it only contained a few short levels, it's primary purpose was to serve as an example for how to do custom block ASM. To this end, it was the first hack to implement the animated "breakable brick" from Mario 3. The brick could be broken only when Mario hit it from below when big or from the side with a cape. It would also turn into a coin when a POW was hit. There were a few other custom blocks as well, such as a block that would break only when Mario hit it with a fireball, and a Mario 3 style frozen coin.

Super Double Dragon
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Beat 'em Up
Release Year: 1992
Developer: Technos
Publisher: Tradewest
_________________________
*
As in the previous Double Dragon games for the arcades and NES, the player takes control of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin martial artists trained in the art of Sosetsuken. The objective of the game, as usual, is to clear all stages from enemies and defeat the stage's boss. Unlike the previous Double Dragon games for home consoles, the player now has a specific button assigned for jumping, instead of having to press the punch and kick buttons at the same time, thanks in part to the inclusion of four face buttons of the SNES control pad. The game also has a button that allows the player's character to block attacks from enemies. If the player block certain enemies' punches, he will be able to grab the enemy's arm and either punch and kick him repeatedly or throw him over the shoulder. The player can also put staggering enemies into a hair grab, much like previous Double Dragon games, and perform similar techniques. Other new techniques include a jumping back kick and a low-to-high kick combo.

The player also has a "Dragon Power" gauge below the life gauge that can be filled out by holding down the L or R buttons, allowing for additional techniques. If the player press the punch or kick button when the gauge is less than half full, then the player will perform a Spinning Back Fist or a Jumping Round Kick. If the player press the punch or kick buttons when the gauge is more than half-full, then the character will perform a flying hurricane kick. The player can also allow the gauge to fill up completely, allowing the use of more powerful punch and kick attacks for a limited time.

This is the first Double Dragon game where Billy and Jimmy are given a different set of basic techniques, though the only real difference is in the animation for their basic punch/combo attack. The explanation given in the Japanese version's manual states that Billy and Jimmy mastered different forms of Sosetsuken, with Billy being a master of Nanha Sosetsuken (the Southern style, which specializes in flexibility), while Jimmy learned Hokuha Sosetsuken (the Northern style, which has stronger techniques). This is also the first game were Billy's and Jimmy's sprites were drawn differently within the game in terms of their haircut, maintaining consistency with Technos Japan's official illustrated depictions of the Lee brothers at the time (where Billy is drawn with brown hair and Jimmy with blond spiky hair, a reversal of the first two arcade games' depiction of the characters).

Weapons featured in this installment include nunchakus, bos, boomerangs, knives and incendiary bombs. The player can also pick a drum can or a large rock and throw it at the enemy. One particular level in Mission 3 allows the player to use punching bags to attack enemies with. One particularly large version of the bag could also be dislodged with enough hits and then picked up and thrown, much like the rock. Unlike the 8-bit NES games, weapons can be carried from one fight to another, even if their original owners are killed, though they can't be carried to a new area.

There are a total of seven stages in the game: a casino in Las Vegas, an airport, a martial arts gym in Chinatown, a fight over a moving truck that's crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, the city slums, a forest/mountain region and the mansion of the Shadow Warriors. The enemy characters consist of: Williams and Roper, returning bad guys from the previous Double Dragon games, who are depicted wearing matching vests and pants; Jeff, a palette swap of Billy; Baker, a thug who wields two Chinese broadswords (Shuangdao); Steve, a martial artist in a business suit; Jackson, a former heavyweight boxer; Cheng Long-Fu and Long-Biao, twin Chinese martial arts masters; McGuire, a clown-like fat man who can block the player's attacks with his gut; Carlem, a tall fighter with a powerful kick; and Duke, the leader of the Shadow Warriors and a former friend of the Lee brothers.

Original Plot:

Unlike previous games in the series, Super Double Dragon does not have an in-game plot. This was not done by design, as cut scenes were prepared for the game, but were not used in the released version due to time constraints.

The proposed storyline does not continue from the events of previous games, but would've been an all new plot. Set in Los Angeles (rather than New York City, the setting of the previous games), Billy and Jimmy Lee set out to investigate the disappearances of several of their students after the arrival of a criminal organization known as the Shadow Warriors. Helping them on their investigation is Marian Kelly, now a policewoman (an occupation she also had in the comics and cartoon series; the latter was under production while the game was made).

Eventually, the leader of the Shadow Warriors is revealed to be a man named Duke, a former childhood friend of the Lee brothers, who is now a corrupted martial artist. At this point, Marian would've been taken captive and the Lee brothers would pursue the gang to Duke's Mansion. In the originally planned final battle, after defeating Duke and saving Marian, Duke's evil self would manifest into his own shadow (similarly to the player fighting his own clone in Double Dragon II: The Revenge). By defeating Duke's Shadow the Lee brothers end his life, but at the same time his soul is now redeemed. The game would end with the main characters visiting Duke's grave.

In the finished game, only part of the plot is mentioned in the manual and Marian the policewoman does not appear in the game at all (although artwork of her was featured in the original Japanese manual). The English version only features a simple scrolling text epilogue, while the Japanese version only has the closing credits.

Earth Defense Force is a pretty fun game. It's a side scrolling shooter, a lot like Gradius or Life Force. The graphics look great and the sounds are pretty good too. The BG music is a little annoying sometimes, but the sound effects were good. like many of these type games, there is no story to speak of.

The gameplay was great. There were several different strategies to choose from. The controls were easy to use and fluid. If you like games like Gradius and Life Force, you'll love Earth Defense Force.

Directions:

You can speed up any time you want to, by pressing X. You gain levels as you gain experience. As you gain levels, your weapons and shields will become stronger. You start with three hit-points worth of shields, you can get up to five. There are also a lot of weapons to choose from, and you can change not only at the beginning, but also between levels. Try different weapons on different levels, figure out which one works best for you. You have two satellites that help you out. By pressing A, you can toggle between them sitting by your side, and circling you. Kill as many enemies as you can, and fight your way to the end through six levels and bosses to save the Earth.

Controls:

A Button - Change Formation
B Button - Shoot
X Button - Speed Up
Y Button - None
Start Button - Start/Pause
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Weapon Selection
When selecting weapons, it's good to know that the S. Laser is hands down the best weapon.

A KNIGHT'S QUEST

All hail, dauntless knight Arthur! Years ago you quelled the terrifying phantoms of the Ghoul Realm who hexed the earth, and rescued Princess Guinevere. Since that time you've journeyed far over the world seeking the powerful weapons of White Magic.

But now the kingdom is shrouded under an eerie spell. Sardius, the Emperor of Evil, has snatched Princess Guinevere away to the slimy crypts of the Phantom Zone. The Ghoul Realm has revived, and the Creatures of the Undead haunt the land.

Once again, you must survive the dangerous journey into the depths of the Ghoul Realm. You'll swat at horrid ectoplasms and ghouls whose touch is deadly. Vampires will swirl around your head. Voracious plants will snap at you, hungry for bones to gnaw. The earth will crack, the seas will swell, and the fiends of darkness will engulf you.

Your courage and skill will keep you moving through overwhelming terrors. And on the path, a mighty weapon - Magic - awaits!

Buckle on your sword, Arthur. It's time to begin your quest!

--from the Super Ghouls and Ghosts instruction manual

Super Ghouls and Ghosts is an action packed ride through an extremely hard game. Although the original Ghosts and Goblins on the NES platform was harder, this one was still pretty challenging. The graphics are very similar, only much better drawn and animated. The sounds were a little different, but all in all they sounded better and still had a Ghosts and Goblins feel to them. If you are a fan of the Ghosts and Goblins series, give Super Ghouls and Ghosts a try!

Directions:

Super Ghouls ans Ghosts was almost the same as the original NES game, it just had a lot of improvements. I especially liked the addition of the double jump. Although it isn't very realistic, it is very handy. Almost all the weapons are the same as the original, except for the ability to power them up. In Super Ghouls and Ghosts, you can get green and gold armor that will power your up your weapon. The green armor will imbue your weapon with a magic ability. The Gold will do the same, with the added effect of a magic ability for you. You will have to hold the attack button for a short time to charge this ability up, though. As if this were not enough, you also get a shield with your gold armor. This will block a small enemy projectile, letting you keep your armor. The enemies were the same except for the fact that they looked a lot batter graphically. The red gargoyles are still the hardest to beat, though. With the exception of the last one, the bosses are all different.

Controls:

A Button - Jump
B Button - Shoot
X Button - None

Start Button - Start/Pause
Select Button - Select

Tips:

Unlike other games of the era, Super Godzilla is not a straight action game. Instead, the player must guide Godzilla into the different levels by pressing the adequate button in the appropriate place. The game is split in two screens: the top one shows the actions Godzilla is making at the moment, while the bottom one shows his location on the current level. When Godzilla finds a monster to battle, the game switches into a standard side-view fighting segment.

This game is known for having Bagan, a monster that was originally supposed to fight Godzilla in a feature film. The game is also known for substituting the original Mechagodzilla for the Heisei Mechagodzilla in the American version of the game because Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II had not been released in American at the time.

Story:

Invading aliens have now approached Earth, threatening all life. The fate of the world lies in the hands in a small group of people, who enlist the aid of the mutant dinosaur Godzilla. Controlling the King of the Monsters through a transmitter on the Super X II, players must lead Godzilla through several cities to fight a final boss that awaits at the end of each level.

Tips:

Skip Current Level
At the title screen, press A, A, B, B, X, X, Y, Y. This will activate the level skip cheat. Then at any point during a level, press L + R to skip to the next level.

Release Year: 1993
Developer: Iguana Entertainment
Publisher: Acclaim
_________________________
*
Super High Impact was one of the most hard hitting football games before the NFL Blitz series was created, with 18 teams and over 30 plays per team. The console versions are based on the Midway arcade series of the same name. The game has a Hit-O-Meter which often leads to massive brawls. Based on the arcade smash hit back in the days, featuring the three famous words: EAT THIS!!!, FIGHT!!!

Tips:

Super High Impact

Easily block kicks
When the computer is going for a field goal or extra point, take control of one of the defensive players all the way in the back of the field goal block formation. When the ball is snapped, run at the long snapper, then turbo at the kicker and jump. The glitch comes in the form is the long snapper never bothering to try blocking you, and you'll be able to block virtually any kick with ease.

Easy defense
When on defense, pick the Suicide defense and take control of either one of the two nose guards. Hold down the Turbo button and direction yourself at the quarterback before the ball is even snapped. On virtually every single play, you'll blast through the line and nail the quarterback before he can even move regardless of whether or not the play is a run or pass, simply because the offensive line never bothers to block you when this trick is performed.

There are several gameplay modes that can be chosen from the main menu of the game. These include exhibition mode, playoff mode, and an Olympic mode that is loosely based on the 1994 Winter Olympics. The object of the Olympic mode is to simply win the gold medal while the defeated team receives a silver medal. In order to qualify for the gold medal game, he or she must rank in the top four in either "League A" or "League B" during the round robin format; an X refers to a win while an O refers to a defeat. Achieving this will promote the player's team to a playoff of eight teams that will determine the gold and silver medal recipients Teams that belong to opposite leagues eventually get to play against each other in the playoff mode.

Periods can either be 1 minutes, 2 minutes or 3 minutes long. Referees can be set to either strict (real), normal, or absent (referred to in the game as free mode). In the real mode, penalties are given for every body check while most body checking is allowed in normal. However, both participants in hockey fights are penalized in both normal and real mode. This is offset by using extremely short durations in the penalty box due to the unrealistically low period durations.

Developer: American Softworks
Publisher: American Softworks
_________________________
*
James Pond is primarily side-scrolling game starring the James Bond spoof hero, James Pond. James Pond is a walking fish with body armour, who is in a battle with his adversary Dr. Maybe. Dr. Maybe has captured lots of penguins as well as toys. Given the code name RoboCod (a pun on RoboCop), the remaining penguins send James on a mission to rescue the other penguins, retrieve the toys and defeat Dr. Maybe.

James starts outside a giant castle that turns out to be Santa's toy factory. There are many doors there, two and two situated next to each other. Each door leads to a stage with many toy-theme levels, 50 in total. Hostile creatures lurk about in these levels, and they come in all thinkable forms. There are no weapons in the game, so James must jump upon them to defeat them. After completing two stages (doors), James goes on to another door where a boss is awaiting.

James's body armour enables him to extend his body vertically to incredible lengths and grab hold of the ceiling. This allows him to travel along the ceiling and drop down on the top of an unsuspecting enemy. James can also pick up items that provide points. Power-ups include extra lives and wings that grant James the ability to fly. From time to time James may enter a vehicle, namely a car, plane or (flying) bath.

Product Placement:

In the original UK version of the game, the penguins featured as in-game product placement for the McVitie's biscuit company's Penguin Biscuits, making it one of the earliest games to use this form of advertising. According to a 1994 article in the UK edition of PC Gamer, Penguin outsold arch-rival KitKat for the first time in the product's history soon after the release of the game.

Tips:

Invincibility
At the start of the game, collect these 5 items in this order:

Cake
Hammer
Earth
Apple
Tap

Power Combo
Collect the following items in order to refill your power batteries-Penguin, Oil Can, Wine Glass, Earth and Racket-spelling POWER.

Unlimited Lives
Go to the Sports level and play until you find a giant white ball on it's own. Collect the items in this order: Lips, Ice cream, Violin, earth and snowman. Now you will have unlimited lives.

SUPER MARIO BROS. THE LOST LEVELS

The Mushroom Kingdom was a peaceful place, until the fateful day that Bowser used his twisted magic to invade it. Bowser turned most of the Mushroom Kingdom's people into rocks, bricks, and mushrooms. He even kidnapped Princess Toadstool and held her captive in his huge castle.

When the Mario Brothers, Mario and Luigi, heard this, they knew that they needed to do something. They decided to battle Bowser and his evil minions to save the Princess. Can they do it?

SUPER MARIO BROS. 2

One evening, Mario had a strange dream. He dreamt of a long, long stairway leading up to a door. As soon as the door opened, he was confronted with a world he had never seen before spreading out as far as his eyes could see. Suddenly, he heard a faint voice saying "Welcome to 'Subcon', the land of dreams. We have been cursed by Wart. Please defeat Wart and save us. Remember, Wart hates vegetables. Please help us!"

The next day, on the way to a picnic, Mario talked to Luigi, Toad, and the Princess about the strange dream he had. After arriving at the picnic area, they found a small cave. When they opened the door in this cave, to their great surprise, the world that Mario saw in his dream spread out before them!

SUPER MARIO BROS. 3

The Mushroom Kingdom has been a peaceful place thanks to the brave deeds of Mario and Luigi. The Mushroom Kingdom forms an entrance to the Mushroom World where all is not well. Bowser has sent his 7 children to make mischief as they please in the normally peaceful Mushroom World. They stole the royal magic wands from each country in the Mushroom World and used them to turn their kings into animals. Mario and Luigi must recover the royal magic wands from Bowser's 7 kids to return the kings to their true forms. "Good-bye and good luck!", said the Princess and Toad as Mario and Luigi set off on their journey deep into the Mushroom World.

--From the SNES Super Mario All Stars instruction manual.

Overview:

Four great Super Mario Bros. games in one package!

Directions:

Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels (JAPAN Super Mario Bros. 2):

This is the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2. Unlike the U.S. version this game is much more similar to SMB1. The Lost Levels does not have Two Player mode.

You can play as Mario or Luigi. Mario is exactly the same as he was in the last game, but Luigi jumps higher and has less traction. Mario resists wind better than Luigi.

Mario and Luigi can get more air from bouncing off enemies than in their last adventure, which is a good thing because you'll be required to do it to make some pretty difficult jumps.

Another new tradition is the Poison Mushroom. Touch this and it's the same as touching an enemy. If you want to know what they look like check the first screen shot.

This game is A LOT harder than the original game. Luckily, you can save in any level by pressing Start and choosing either Save and Continue or Save and Quit.

One final word of warning, there are warp zones in the game that will send you BACK to earlier levels. Watch out! 

Controls:

B Button - Jump/Fly
Y Button - Shoot Fireballs, Tail Whip, hold to Run
Start Button - Pause/Save
Select Button - Nothing

Tips:

(SMB 1) High Score Reset
On the title screen, press A, B, L, and R all at the same time. 

(SMB 1) Restart after game over
Hold A + B on the gameover screen, then press start.

(SMB 1)
If you finish a level (touch the flagpole) when the ones digit of the time is 1, 3, or 6, there will be that many fireworks and each one is worth 500 points.

(SMB1) Warp to world 5
Get on top of the ceiling in world 4-2 and run past the end pipe that leads to the flagpole. You will find a lone pipe that warps you to world 5

(SMB1) Warp Zone to Level 2, 3, and 4
To find a Warp Zone that can take you Level 2, 3, or 4 go to the part of world 1-2 then get to the part of the world at the end where all the platforms are moving up. Jump on one, then leap on top of the ceiling from there. Keep going until you reach five pipes.  It'll say 'Welcome to Warp Zone!' with a number above each pipe. The 2 takes you to level 2, the three to level 3, and the four to level four.

(SMB1) Warp Zone to Levels 6, 7, and 8
Go to world 4-2  Go past the first set of down platforms to 3 seemingly unreachable blocks.  Uncover 2 invisible blocks under the rightmost and center bricks by jumping. Hit the left brick to sprout a vine. Climb the vine up and proceed right. You will find Warp zones 6, 7, and 8

(SMB 2) Kill Yourself
Pause then hold L + R and press select. 

(SMB2) Warp to World 4-1
Take a potion to the isolated vase to the right of the door into the building in 1-3. Place the potion close to the vase and go through the door to Sub Space.  Stand on top of the vase while in Sub Space and press Down on the d-pad to warp to World 4-1

(SMB2) Warp to World 5-1
Go to World 3-1 and enter the door to the waterfall and clouds. Drop down the waterfall to a door way down below. Find the potion in the huge patch of vegetables and take it to the vase next to the door.  Enter Sub Space and stand on top of the vase and press down on the d-pad to enter the vase. You will be taken to 5-1

(SMB2) Warp to World 6-1
Go to World 4-2 and proceed to the whales. Find a potion and get to the island with the vase. Place the potion down and enter the door that appears to go into Sub Space. Warp down the vase to World 6-1

(SMB2) Warp to World 7-1
Go to World 5-3 and find a potion. Proceed all the way back left and use Luigi's squat jump or an enemy to get to the platform with the vase. Drop the potion and enter Sub Space and warp down the vase to World 7-1

(SMB 3) Hidden White Mushroom Houses
In certain levels, the screen moves forward and pushes you along. If you get a certain number of coins within these said levels, you unlock a secret white mushroom house holding a powerful item. Below are the levels and the number of coins needed in each level. 

White mushroom house: Level 1-4  Collect 44 coins within the level
White mushroom house: Level 2-2  Collect 30 coins within the level
White mushroom house: Level 3-8  Collect 41 coins within the level
White mushroom house: Level 4-2  Collect 22 coins within the level
White mushroom house: Level 5-5  Collect 28 coins within the level
White mushroom house: Level 6-7  Collect 78 coins within the level
White mushroom house: Level 7-2  Collect 41 coins within the level

(SMB3)'Hide' behind scenery
To 'hide' behind scenery, simply hold down for a couple seconds while standing on a white block. Then your player can 'hide' behind scenery for about thirty seconds.

(SMB3) Warp Whistles
Level 1-3
Find the white block near the end and crouch on to of it for 5 seconds. Then proceed to the goal, and go behind it. You will find a Mushroom house with a Whistle.

Level 1 Fortress
Fly over the top of the level when you find the first door with your raccoon powers, and find a hidden door at the far right on the ceiling. It leads to a warp whistle

Level 2 Hammer Brother
Get the Hammer from one of the Hammer Brothers here and use it to destroy the rock at the upper right corner of the Level 2 Map. Then engage the hammer brother on the other side. You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.

(SMB3) 28 P-Wings
Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You will start at World 1 with 28 P-Wings.

(SMB3) Harmless Bowser
At the end of the game, when Bowser uses his jump attack on you, duck if you are big Mario, or stay still if you are small Mario. Bowser will break the bricks, but he won't hurt you. If you are small Mario, you can run right through Bowser and not get hurt.

In other words, Bowser's lower half is harmless, but his upper half can still hurt you.

(SMB3) Infinite items
Complete levels until you get to toad's mushroom house, where you get to open a chest for an item. Get the item, save and exit. Now reload the file and the levels you finished will still be completed but toads house will be back so you can get the item again! :D  Repeat until you have as many as you need. Also this works for the extra lives slot and the memory card game houses too.

(SMB3) Morph a wandering hammer brother into a treasure ship.  To turn a wandering hammer brother (the ones that walk about on the world map) into a white ship full of coins, collect a number of coins that is a multiple of 11. Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11. Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.  One combination would be: 11 coins, 9, 310 as your score, and the timer at 104. This only works in worlds 1, 3, 5, and 6.

(SMB3) To get the N-Spade Card Game
To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map. You must do gain 80, 000 points as one player, and successfully beat the stage that you broke the 80, 000 points with.

(SMB: LL) High Score Reset
On the title screen, press A, B, L, and R all at the same time. 

(SMB: LL) World 9
To get World 9 in the Lost Levels, beat all 32 levels (World 1-1 to 8-4) in order without using any Warp Zones and you will go to World 9. If you beat World 9 you can go to Worlds A-D (which you can access if you beat the game with warping though).

(SMB: LL) Extra Life at the flagpole
To get an Extra Life, make sure that when you touch the flagpole, the last digit of the timer is a multiple of
the number of coins you have (Example: TIMER = 231/COINS = 11). This also works with 0. Do this correctly and instead of getting a point bonus, you will get a 1-UP.

(SMB: LL) 5000 points from Timer
Make sure you're Fire Mario/Luigi when you reach Bowser. Blast him with fireballs, but don't grab the axe just yet. Instead, wait the timer out, but make sure you're next to the axe when there's about 50 seconds left. Now get ready and time your jump on the axe so the Timer reads '000'. Once you reach Toad and the game adds the Timer to your score, you may notice that it changed from '000' to '999'. Thus the game thinks you finished with '1000' on the Timer and times that by 5. Note: this does not work on the Original NES version of the game.

This patch may not look like much. In fact, it isn't much. But there-in lies the beauty of the patch! Rather than changing a vast many graphic or removing the backgrounds, the author decided to instead simply change some minor things here and there. The patch does exactly what it sets out to do: return Super Mario Bros. in Super Mario All-Stars to its roots by altering many graphics that were changed in the transition from the NES to the Super NES back to their original NES ones, though much prettier. If the grass in World 1-1 or the strange bricks in the world castles bugged you as much as it did Deespence2929  and I know it bugged me!  then this patch is for you!

Translation Description:

Since I was sick of seeing grass in world 1-1 where bricks should be I put together a hack to change several of the graphics of SMB1 in Super Mario All-Stars. It changes them to graphics which are much closer to what they were in the 8-bit game. The backgrounds have not been touched. The ROM needs to be unheadered.

Note that since Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels shares graphics with SMB that game will be affected as well. This game has not been tested to see if the changes remain throughout the game.

This is an exceptional remake of all 32 levels of Super Mario Bros. 1, including the "Minus World", and "World 36", with SMB Allstars (SMB3) style graphics.

It's an original and refreshing take to be able to play such a classic with the up to date Super Mario World game engine. While it is similar to Super Mario All Stars, it's still very different. Everything is changed in this hack. There are new over worlds, some additional custom levels, changed tunes and more!

On top of that, many of the original's secrets and glitches are also there. The author paid good attention to detail! If you were a fan of the original SMB, you really should try this hack out.

Hi everybody! Thanks for dropping to by the Super Mario Kart race track. My name is Lakitu, I run this track. If you need my help, I'll be around.

We race one seater, metal pipe frame go carts here. There are two engine sizes to choose from: 50cc or 100cc. All of the go carts are more or less the same, it's the individual drivers that make the difference when it comes to winning. Each driver has their strengths and weaknesses. Try using different drivers until you find the best one for you.

--From the SNES Super Mario Kart instruction manual.

Overview:

Become the greatest kart racer in the whole Mushroom Kingdom! All the racers are determined. You better be, too, because the competition will be fierce and the courses are very unpredictable! So keep your wits, and good luck!

Directions:

Like any racing game, get to the finish before any of the other racers.

There are 4 modes of play: The 1 Player Grand Prix, where you race against the computer to win! The 2 Player Grand Prix, where it's basically the same as 1 Player, except you play with another person! The Battle Mode is where you can use weapons against the computer! Finally the Time Trial is where you race to get low times to beat your latest record. 

Controls:

A Button - Use weapon
B Button - Accelerate
X Button - Behind View
Y Button - Brake
L Button - Hop
R Button - Hop
Start Button - Pause/Unpause
Select Button - Behind View

Hints:

Shortcuts
Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for shortcuts, the other guys won't take them. 

Tips:

Small Racers
When at the character select screen (only in racing) hold Y and push A and your character will become small.  This will not effect speed whatsoever, it will only make it so your opponents can run you over to slow you down. Hold Y and push A to make yourself big again.

Unlock Special Cup
At the cup select screen, press the following buttons in order: L, R, L, R, L, L, R, R.

Unlock Special Cup on Time Trial
Go to Time Trial, put the cursor on Mushroom Cup and press: L, R, L, R, L, L, R, R, A. If you haven't unlocked Special Cup already, it'll be available now.

Unlockables

150cc Circuit 
Obtain the Gold Cup in the Mushroom, Flower, Star,  and Special Cups in the 100cc mode.

Special Cup Tracks 
Win the Gold Cup in the Mushroom, Flower, and Star Cups in 100cc

Camera Pan
Choose any character and go to any time trial and finish it without making any mistakes. Now, when you watch the little replay clip of your race, press L or R to make the camera swing around your character.

Extra Credits
If you finish three races in the same place, you'll earn an extra continue.

Ghost Racer Save, Race Against Saved Ghost
When you have a ghost that you'd like to save in Time Trials, hold L, R, and Y at the menu screen that displays after you've completed a Time Trial race and press X. The name of the course on which the ghost was saved will be highlighted in yellow on the Course Select menu. To race against the ghost you saved, choose the course (the one highlighted in yellow) and hold L or R while pressing B when the screen asks 'Is this OK?' and the arrow is pointing to 'Yes'.

Race ghost COM player in Time Trials.
Select 1P Time Trials and then on the select driver screen, press START on 2nd controller. It will bring up a driver select for COM. Select who you want it to be. You can now race a ghost driver anytime.

Speed Boost
This speed boost can occur at the beginning of a race.  When the three lights begin to count down, if you press
the Acceleration button just before the second light lights up, and you hold it until the race starts, you get a boost of speed. If this speed boost is timed and positioned right, it can easily put you in first place right from the start.

I've been a fan of Super Mario Kart since I first played it in the early/mid nineties. Late last year I happened upon a romhack called Super Mario Kart: Pro Edition and was very impressed at the quality (though I was humbled by its difficulty). It inspired me to start my own hack of the tracks, with a focus on maintaining the feel of the original game.

Every track has been replaced by one I've created completely myself, including the Battle Mode courses. I've tried to avoid putting in overly complicated or silly courses like some hacks of this game have, but at the same time I've snuck in a couple of new ideas.

The AI works in all courses, and offers a challenge, but is far from unbeatable.

Super Mario Kart makes its comeback!

This hack is a complete remake of SMK, featuring 20 new tracks. The AI also works, meaning you'll have to work for that first place in GP mode.

For when you're feeling more like hitting your friends with shells and bananas, there's also 4 new battle mode courses for you and your friends to determine who is the champion of battle once and for all.

If you played the original SMK and felt that you needed more of a challenge or wanted more to experience, then download this hack. You won't be disappointed.

This is a ROM hack of Super Mario RPG that shows off what you can do with the statistical, gameplay (battle system-wise aspects of the of this masterpiece constructed by the combined efforts of Nintendo and Squaresoft (now Square Enix) mostly, but also shows what you can do in terms of attack animations and other.

- Characters can go level up to Level 50

- All bosses and enemies' battle scripts changed

- Character stats changed around

- Spells changed

- All Enemy stats changed

- Dialogue changes (Mostly in-battle, but some out-of-battle as well)

- New enemies and enemy name changes

- Well-balanced difficulty curve

- Timing for Weapons, defense and spells changed considerably

- A few new attacks and spells

- Some new items and equipments

Changes made from Remix:

- Solves problems with some enemies/bosses with multiple attacks (i.e. Enemies attacking after characters have died, leads to bug where enemy jumps offscreen and attacks nothing, only to come back some minutes later).

- Mallow with Shocker at the beginning instead of Thunderbolt as his first spell (Some enemies changed a bit to compensate for this).

- Balance out stats between characters and increase HP stat boosts

- Change enemy encounters around a bit (i.e. Mushroom Way, a Goomba encounter might give you two Goombas and a Koopa Troopa).

- Improved certain boss and enemy tactics as well as stats to make a little tougher/more balanced.

- Fixed the bug where it says that your character will gain a new special at Level 51. The max level is 50 in this game.

- Changed Geno Whirl's stats (It will always hit now, sometimes will hit 9999 on its own, but timing for guaranteed 9999 is VERY hard like Geno Boost's).

- Changed stats for a few pieces of equipment (Masher, Lazy Shell).

- ALL Weapons have small changes to timing (Mainly just for the strongest level of the attack).

- Changes to most Psychopath messages

- Fixed problem with "Ready, Get Set, Go!" message on Booster Hill.

- Small fixes with some out-of-battle text messages

- Improved enemy evasion for most enemies.

- Balanced FP cost and all-targeting attacks

- Lessened overall EXP gain to compensate for Lucky Jewel, Lucky! Bonus, and the special Hammer.

- EXP Booster costs twice the amount of Coin Trick now.

- Balanced the stat-boosting items

One day, while visiting Mario, Princess Toadstool was picking flowers in the garden ...

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Bowser appeared and grabbed the Princess again! (Like you'd expect anyone else to?) Mario, hearing Toadstool's scream for help, sped off alone toward Bowser's Keep. After Mario trounced Bowser for the millionth time (this time they fought on one of Bowser's chandeliers), everyone felt Bowser's Keep beginning to shake!

A HUGE sword crashed into Bowser's Keep! What's gonna happen now?

--From the SNES Super Mario RPG instruction manual.

Overview:

Super Mario RPG is a lot of fun to play. The first Mario game to be an RPG is really saying something about the popularity of RPG's. It's a little weird at first, but once you get used to it, it's a lot of fun. There are a lot of special moves to learn and a lot of bad guys that need killing. Super Mario RPG is a lot of fun if you are a fan of RPG's or Mario. If you fall into that criteria, and chances are you do, then check this game out. 

Directions:

Super Mario RPG is more hands on than other RPGs. You HAVE to learn how to time attacks or you will find the game very difficult. You can also jump in Mario fashion around the towns/houses/dungeons. Toad will teach you everything you need to know.

Controls:

A Button - Talk/Accept
B Button - Jump/Cancel/Etc. Command
X Button - Menu/Use Items
Y Button - Run/Special
L Button - Switch to Stereo or Mono on File Select Screen
R Button - Switch to Stereo or Mono on File Select Screen
Start Button - Start
Select Button - Switch to Stereo or Mono on File Select Screen

Tips:

Hidden command
Notice: this only works in the SFC/Japanese version.  Open the menu screen (by pressing X), then press Down, Up, Right, Left, Select, Start, Select, Start, B.  Kinopio (Toad) pops up and asks to see your status, giving you little tips and tricks.

Secret Items
Attack Scarf 
You must perform 30 consecutive Super Jumps in battle.  After you do that, talk to the dog in Monstro Town that counts the number of times you jumped.

Bright Card 
In Booster's Tower, after you beat Land's End, travel through the tower some, You will see Knife Guy, win his game 8 times and he will give you this.

Fertilizer 
After you beat Nimbus Palace, there will be a secret path on the right of Nimbus Town. Talk to the Shy Guy.

Getting the Super Suit 
You must perform 100 consecutive Super Jumps on an enemy in battle. After you do that, talk to the dog in Monstro Town that counts your jumps.

Lamb's Lure
Use the Mystery Egg 10 times with the Princess, she must have the B'Tub Ring equipped.

Sheep Attack 
Use Lamb's Lure 48 times in battle. 

Star Egg 
Win Grate Guy's 'Look the other way' game 100 times. It does NOT have to be in a row.

Troopa Pin 
In Land's End, on the Troopa Jumping game, if you get 12 seconds or under, you will earn this.

2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1
One time only in the game you can change into a 2D Mario walking around on a 3D landscape. It is pretty cool. The image turns sideways when you turn diagonal.  In booster tower, I think it's right after the room with a switch that opens a passage of booster pass.  There is a large curtain near the exit. Go in the right side and coming out the right side wont do it but going in the right and coming out the left causes the transformation.

Cameo: F-Zero and Star Fox
In the uppermost right corner, you can see F-Zero and Star Fox racers in Hinopio's shop on Barrel Volcano.

Cameo: Link and Samus
These two popular characters play no significant role in the game.

To find Link, return to the Rosa Inn (same place where you played with that Gaz girl) after you find the 2nd star. He'll be upstairs sleeping in the bed. Try to talk to him and the Zelda Mystery noise plays.

To find Samus, go to the Mushroom Kingdom after securing the 5th star. Go into the castle, then to the guest room. Samus will be sleeping in the bed. If you talk to her, she says she's resting for Mother brain.

Samus Cameo 2
When you reach Booster Tower and get to the top where you talk to ome-what spoiler character through the door. After this conversation look in the box where Booster and his Snifits are talking. There is a samus action figure.

Easy Level Up's
Look for a place where a star is next to a save point.  Save, then get the star, level up as many times as you can. Then die (in game) and you will still have your levels, as well as be able to use the star again :-).

Easy Level up

Geno 9999 attack trick
After you acquire Geno, put him in your party. After he learn the move Geno Whirl, enter battle. Use Geno Whirl and a tornado like wind will come onto the screen. Push Y right before it leaves the screen for 9999 attack points.
Note: You will hear a crackling sound if you did it right. This does not work on all enemies (ie bosses)

Infinite Money
When you are on the path going towards Rosa town, get to the section where all of the ShyGuys are standing on
top of the treasure boxes. Go to the bottom right side of the screen to the exit. Hit the box next to the door and get a few coins (but do not empty it, leave some in) then go through the exit. As soon as you go through the exit, go back through and hit the box more times (still don't empty it). Then just repeat this until you have a many coins as you want, it won't go empty!

Mushroom Castle's hidden box
Many who search for all of the Hidden Treasure Boxes  are stumped by the one in the Mushroom Kingdom Castle.  Ordinarily, you can find any hidden Treasure box at multiple points in the game. The one in Mushroom castle, however, has only 1 opportunity, and that is at the beginning of the game. On your first visit to the castle, be sure to jump on Toad's head and ride him to where the door is. You can now jump onto the ledge right above the door and find a Treasure box that can't be found at any other point in the game.

BS Super Mario USA is the game that we knew as Super Mario Bros. 2, released on the Japan-only BS Satellaview system. You know, the system that let you download and play games only on certain dates and times? Well, the game is just like Super Mario Bros. 2 on Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES, except there's no music (probably an emulation issue), and there are hidden statues in the game. There are four known dumps, and each dump goes through one world and a final boss. Oh yeah, there's a score, too! And it seems like characters speak to you, but you can't hear or read anything for some reason. And you can only use Mario.

But the games are just as fun as the original.

Translation Description:

This patch translates what little text that shows up on the games, which is when you can change the control scheme or when you check the status inbetween levels. The patch was originally tested to work on BS Mario 1 by KingMike, but I've tested it on all four roms and it works perfectly.

After saving the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser and the rest of the Koopas in Super Mario 3, Mario and Luigi needed to recuperate from their adventures. Together they agreed that the best place to vacation was a magical place called Dinosaur Land.

But while Mario and Luigi reclined on the beach for a relaxing nap, Princess Toadstool disappeared, apparently seized by evil forces. After searching for hours for their missing friend, Mario and Luigi came upon an enormous egg in the forest.

Suddenly the egg hatched, and out popped a young dinosaur named YOSHI, who proceeded to tell Mario and Luigi a sad tale of how his dinosaur pals were sealed in similar eggs by a group of monsterous turtles.

"Monsterous turtles!" exclaimed Luigi. "Bowser and his bunch have returned!" Mario slowly nodded his head in agreement and, along with Luigi and Yoshi, set off across Dinosaur Land to find the Princess and to free Yoshi's friends. As they began their journey, Yoshi handed Mario a beautiful cape. "This may help you," Yoshi said. "Some say it has magical powers."

With a little luck (and help from a magic cape), our hearty crew can defeat the seven worlds of Bowser's Krazy Koopa Kritters. Many locations are well-hidden so explore everywhere and try everything. Not all locations have to be explored to rescue the dinosaurs and save Princess Toadstool, but there are many "starry" treasures to be found in far-reaching places. You'll need to search all areas to find out what kinds of treasure are there... in Super Mario World.

--From the SNES Super Mario World instruction manual.

Overview:

Super Mario World was one of the first games released for the SNES and one of the best Super Mario games ever. More people have played Super Mario World than any other game that I know of, and that should be a testament in and of itself. I have played this game more than any other game in my life, and that is the truth.

Super Mario World was one of the easiest games to learn how to play but one of the hardest to master. The graphics in Super Mario World are awesome, the color and design are just perfect, and the controls felt great. You also had a few new moves, including a new spinning jump that comes in handy. Also Super Mario World brought a new character to life, our beloved Yoshi. Yoshi is a friendly dino that helps Mario and Luigi save their kidnapped friends. Super Mario World was also filled with tons of secrets and cool new levels. So run, jump, and fly your way through this wonderful place known as Super Mario World to save the Princess one more time.

Directions:

Super Mario World is similar to the Super Mario Bros. games, you jump on enemies to kill them. Sometimes, you'll need the fire flowers to vanquish certain enemies. Use the new cape and feather to fly in the levels like a superhero! Go to switch palaces to fill in dotted areas with a block.

You now have two different ways to jump, the standard and a spinning jump. The spinning jump will totally destroy some enemies, and will allow you to jump off of Yoshi. This jump will also make you fire several fireballs when you have firepower. Pushing the L or R button will move the camera either left or right.

The object is to defeat Bowser. There are several different ways to get there, because finishing certain levels in different ways will unlock secret paths to his palace. Any level that is a red dot has at least two different ways to beat it. Each ghost house will also have at least two ways to finish, a right way, a wrong way, and sometimes a secret way. After you have beaten a level, you can still go back there, and when you do, you can press start and then select to exit it at any time.

At the end of each level there is a finish line with a tape moving up and down, which you need to break. Try to break the tape at the highest point possible. The higher you break the tape, the more stars you will be awarded. If you get 100 stars, you get to go to a bonus level where you try to line up shapes in a tic-tac-toe order. Every three in a row is worth an extra life. There is also a halfway point in each level that looks like a much smaller finish line. Whenever you get to one of these, you will grow big if you are small, and you will be able to start at that point if you die.

Any time you collect 100 coins you will also be awarded an extra life. If you can jump on the heads of enough enemies without touching the ground, you will be awarded an extra life, too. Extra men can also be obtained by finding a one-up mushroom in a prize block. The one-up mushroom is white and green. Prize blocks may also contain coins, a power mushroom (white and red) that makes you grow if you're small, a fire-flower that will give you the ability to shoot fireballs, or a feather that will give you a cape good for flying and slapping enemies to death. The red mushroom, fire-flower, and feather can be stored for later if you find one while you already have it. For instance, if you are big Mario and find a red mushroom, it will be placed in the box at the top of the screen until you get hit. At this point, it will fall from the box and you will have to catch it. You can also release whatever power-up you have in the box by pressing Select.

Some boxes will contain a set of wings for Yoshi, and if you grab them while riding one, you will be taken to a bonus level, and your Yoshi will be a purple one from then on. Prize boxes may also contain a Yoshi egg. If you have no Yoshi, the egg will hatch a Yoshi, or a baby Yoshi. If you do have a Yoshi, it will hatch a one-up mushroom.

A full grown Yoshi is ready to ride, hop on its back and start eating. Yoshis will eat almost any enemy. Also, eating certain enemies will give Yoshi certain powers. When Yoshi eats a green turtle, he can spit the shell out like a projectile that you can use to hit your enemies. A red turtle will make Yoshi blow out three fireballs when spit out. A yellow shell will make Yoshi seem heavy and he will be able to totally destroy some enemies by jumping on or near them. A purple shell will make Yoshi sprout wings and he will be able to fly. While riding you Yoshi, you can spin jump to get off, or press B to make him stick his tongue out as an attempt to eat something. Everything Yoshi eats gives you one coin. Yoshi will try to run from you if you are hit by an enemy while riding him.

If you find a baby Yoshi, you must feed him five things to make him grow into an adult. There are several different colors of baby Yoshi's. There are green, red, purple, and yellow. The green is the default Yoshi. Every other color Yoshi has the ability to use whatever special power that goes with the shell of the same color whenever any shell is eaten. For example, a purple Yoshi gains the ability to fly when it eats any color shell. If it were to eat a red shell, it could fly until it spit it out, which would come out as three fireballs.

There are also P buttons to watch out for. Some P buttons will make coins appear for a certain amount of time, when this happens collect as many as you can before the time runs out and the coins disappear. Some of them will make a hidden door appear, if this happens get through the door before the time is up and the door disappears. Some of them will turn blocks into coins, get as many as you can before the time runs out and the coins turn back into blocks. Sometimes you will want to use coins as blocks during this process to get to platforms you would not be able to get to otherwise. In these cases climb up to your spot before the blocks turn back into coins.

Sometimes there will be little triangles in front of a wall that will allow you to run up the wall if you use the run button to run at the wall. These will make Yoshi bounce real high if you are riding him at the time.

There are eight worlds that are full of levels. Some of the levels you will be able to skip if you find the secrets. At the last level of each world, you have to beat one of King Koopa's kids to advance to the next world. 

Controls:  

A Button - Get on Yoshi, Spin Jump
B Button - Jump, Swim
X Button - Run, Pick up item, Use fireball
Y Button - Same as "X" button
L Button - Move screen to left slightly
R Button - Move screen to right slightly
Start Button - Pause/Unpause
Select Button - Drops boxed item on top of screen

Tips:

Original SMB music
In Super Mario World, go to the Special World. If you sit there and do nothing for a few minutes, the Super Mario Brothers theme will start playing! It goes back to the Special World music if you leave the map by any way (going to a level or exiting).

Generate Extra Power Switches
Power Switches are those in-game blue buttons that reverse the rolls of the coins and solid bricks and vice-versa upon jumping on top of them. During the split-second 'pressed flat' animation of the button after usage, you can use Yoshi to lick it back up--when you spit it out, it will be an entirely new Power Switch that will extend the duration of the effect of the switch.

Easy Extra Life
Beat a stage with your time ending in the same digit repeated twice as the tens place of your Star total, and you'll be awarded an extra life.
Example:
With 17 stars, beat the stage with your time ending in 11.

Item Conversion
Try holding an item (shell, trampoline, etc) and cross the Goal line. The item you're carrying will turn into a 1-Up mushroom.

Re-enter finished Castles and Fortresses
After you beat a castle or fortress you cannot normally re-enter it. To re-enter a castle or a fortress press L + R at the same time and you will enter the castle/fortress.

Berry Freeze
Enter a level with Yoshi, Cape Mario, and a Fire Flower in reserve. Position yourself under a berry in a way that you can get the fire flower and get the berry at the same time. If you happen to eat the flower and the berry at the same time, the game will freeze.  Several things have been reported while using this glitch. Sometimes when the game freezes, your coin count will rise until you quickly have 99 lives. Press Start and Select to exit the level. One
person's game froze, horizontal lines appeared on the screen, and weird music kept looping over and over again. Then came a buzzing noise, and he was returned to the file select screen, with his file deleted. Thankfully, that's not normal. Even so, this is an interesting glitch to exploit every once in a while.

This story happened a long long time ago... This is a story about a baby and Yoshi...

A stork hurries across the dusky, pre-dawn sky. In his bill, he supports a pair of twins who are to be delivered to their parents as soon as possible.

Suddenly, something appears between the clouds and races towards the stork with blinding speed!

'SSCCRREEEEECH!!!', it screams. 'These babies are mine!'

Snatching only one baby, the creature vanishes into the darkness from whence it came.

Oh no! The second baby falls undetected towards the open sea...

The kidnapper is Kamek, an evil Magikoopa from the Koopa Kingdom. Having divined last night that twin babies born this morning will bring disaster to the Koopa family, he arranged for an early morning ambush. Returning to his castle, Kamek realizes that he missed the other baby. He orders his toadies.

'Go forth and find the other baby!! Don't let his parents get him back! Ever!!'

Meanwhile, the second baby does not fall into the sea after all...it lands safely on Yoshi's back! And right after him drops a map!!

This paradise is Yoshi's Island. And on this island lives lots of different Yoshies. These Yoshies are naturally laid back and relaxed, but this is a calamity and everyone is in a state of panic. As the Yoshies frantically yell over each other, the baby insistently points at something.

Yes! The baby can sense the other baby?s location. All the Yoshies quickly agree to help carry the baby to its destination by using a relay system not unlike the old pony express.

The Green Yoshi draws first honors.

--From the SNES Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island instruction manual.

Overview:

Kamek, the leader before Bowser, heard news of two twins that were extra amazing. Knowing they could possibly defeat the new born Bowser (and did later, as we all know) he casts a spell and sends them to Yoshi's Island, trying to keep them there forever! Now, the Yoshies must return them to their natural state and make sure they grow up to save the universe!

Directions:

Take Baby Mario for a ride with 8 different colored Yoshies through 6 worlds of 8 levels each. Avoid contact with the enemies in each level or Baby Mario will be placed in a floating protective bubble for a certain amount of time. If you lose Baby Mario to the Shy Guys, you lose a life. Eat the enemies you can and turn them into eggs to toss to collect coins, defeat other enemies, find secrets, or clear paths. Stomp on enemies and eliminate them for ever! Collect the 5 flowers in each level to increase your chance of going to a bonus world. Use the abilities given to you to stop the crazy bosses and find abilities to get you through a level. Equip items in key moments to add a bit of extra "fire" power or even freeze your oncoming enemies. Go through many castles and if lucky and clever enough you'll reach a 100% completion of the game.

Controls:

A Button - Throw Egg / Select
B Button - Jump hold For Float
X Button - N/A
Y Button - Throw Tongue / Hold To Speed Up
L Button - N/A
R Button - N/A
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - N / A

Hints:

Make Eggs yellow and red
It's best to have a full supply of green eggs for this trick. Find a place in a level where you can aim straight up without hitting anything else (i.e.: level 6-4 would be a good one, after you hit a door, but don't go in yet). Stock up on eggs if you don't have any, then aim straight up. Throw an egg and after it hits the ceiling once, have Yoshi catch it with his tongue. It should stop bouncing and be a yellow egg (if it was green to begin with). Throw another egg, this time letting it hit the ceiling twice, then catch it. It should have turned red. Doing this trick right will help you make your score better, as red eggs give 2 stars that can be used on the Baby Timer that appears when Mario falls off Yoshi's back.

Tips:

Shortcut to Mini-games
While at the level select screen, hold down SELECT and type: X X Y B A

Alternate Title Screen
Simply 100% the game and you'll have an alternate title screen that shows yoshi's island but instead of it being daytime on the island it will be night

Unlock secret levels and bonus games in each world To unlock a bonus level and one of the 6 bonus games (when you get a flower on a roulette on the end of the level), finish a world with a 100 on each level to unlock the level and bonus game. These levels are tough for beginners. Here are the bonus games unlocked in each world:

World 1: Flip Cards
World 2: Scratch 'n' Match
World 3: Drawing Lots
World 4: Match Cards
World 5: Roulette
World 6: Slot Machine

Eating Baby Mario
You must have the +10 or +20 star item in your pause screen or it won't work. It works on any level that has a metamorphosis bubble, but it works best on level 5-5 (Goonie Rides!!), where I discovered it. In 5-5, reach the first middle ring, and then you will notice the metamorphosis helicopter bubble ahead.  Don't touch it yet. Instead, walk to the edge of the cliff. You will see the white Goonies flying your way.  Let one hit you and let baby Mario cry in the
air. Now, before the timer runs out, run left until the helicopter bubble is at the right edge of the screen.  Don't move from there. Baby Mario will float around the helicopter bubble. Let the timer reach zero.  When the red Toadies come and begin carrying him away, lick baby Mario from them, and quickly touch the helicopter bubble while the timer is still 0. When you finish morphing, the Toadies will come back and try to take baby Mario with them, even though you're a helicopter (Don't touch the baby while they are trying to take him, or you will freeze the scroll of the screen!). Now, when all four Toadies are about to take off with baby Mario, immediately pause the game and activate a +10 or +20 stars item. The red Toadies will let go of baby Mario, but he will still be crying in his bubble (and you are a helicopter!). Now touch baby Mario as a helicopter. The bubble will pop and then baby Mario will be stuck in a tiny bubble that doesn't even close around him (If you dont touch him as a helicopter, theres a glitch when the helicopter runs out: youll get Mario back, but the timer wont countdown if you get hit, as long as you dont touch a helicopter bubble again). Now, you can do one of two things:

a) Wait until the helicopter power runs out. If that happens, you will be transformed back into Yoshi.  But notice anything strange? Baby Mario is still in that tiny bubble, and he is off your back! Now this is the cool thing though. You can lick baby Mario and he will go into Yoshi's mouth! If you swallow him, he will turn into an egg that can't damage Goonies! If you spit him back out, he will still be in the tiny bubble and slide around until he falls off the stage. You can't even lick him back into your mouth!

b) Head to the Yoshi Block as a helicopter at the end of this part of the stage. Avoid the Goonies and Green Piranas, and hit the Yoshi Block. The baby will transport where you are, and you will transform back into Yoshi. But the funny thing is that once again, you have no Baby Mario on your back. And Mario's bubble will return to normal size, but he will start floating up infinitely! You will lose him unless you can lick him before he floats away. Now, you can swallow him again and turn him into an egg, but if you spit him out, he will float around in his bubble up and down and move horizontally (you'll see what I mean) and won't stop. If you happen to spit him at a winged cloud, he will activate it but Mario will explode in the process! You cannot lick Baby Mario back into your mouth if you spit him out either.

These are fun glitches to try but remember that you must have the +10 or +20 star item and must have a metamorphosis bubble in the course. I have succeeded in other courses with many Yoshi shapes. But let me warn you that if you pull off this glitch, you cannot leave the course or beat it without pressing start and select. Oh, and you will have baby Mario on your back again if you do leave the course. Have fun pulling this one off, gamers!

999 Lives Trick
In World 1-7 (Touch Fuzzy Get Dizzy), you'll see these little enemies near the beginning that do nothing but stand still, occasionally jump up and down and turn into a ball. They may look pointless, but they're a shortcut to maxing out your lives.

Grab one of them, then run right until you see a pipe that infinitely spawns Shy Guys. Spit out your little friend in that inch wide area you see between the pipe and the wall, then jump to the platform to the right of the pipe. Every time a Shy Guy comes out of the pipe, it'll jump into your little friend and kill itself. You'll eventually start getting a 1Up every time a Shy Guy dies, and if you stand there long enough, you can get as many lives as you want, all the way up to 999.

Make Eggs yellow and red
It's best to have a full supply of green eggs for this trick. Find a place in a level where you can aim straight up without hitting anything else (ie: level 6-4 would be a good one, after you hit a door, but don't go in yet). Stock up on eggs if you don't have any, then aim straight up. Throw an egg and after it hits the ceiling once, have Yoshi catch it with his tongue. It should stop bouncing and be a yellow egg (if it was green to begin with). Throw another egg, this time letting it hit the ceiling twice, then catch it. It should have turned red. Doing this trick right will help you make your score better, as red eggs give 2 stars that can be used on the Baby Timer that appears when Mario falls off Yoshi's back.

Hehe? this hack is probably the biggest bullshit hack ever made. It's garbage! This hack is full with glitches, bad colour palettes, annoying and simple level designs, and a lot of message boxes with senseless and funny comments - very bad english included. Made as a spoof of the typical bad newbie hacks. Play it? and have fun? :D

NOTE FROM Rx: I seriously think that this may be my all time favorite hack.  It might get old after I play it a while, but I've never laughed at a hack like this one before.  Seriously give this game a try.

No doubt some of you are aware by now of the brand new Super Mario World Internet sensation sweeping the web; Super Mario World (Kaizo Edition). Not for the faint-hearted, this particular ROM hack appears to be developed by Satan himself, utilising some of SMW's most notorious enemies and obstacles in near-ridiculous situations to produce possibly the most insane 'game' ever created. It really has to be seen (and played) to be believed.

This is a complete hack of Super Mario World. All the levels and worlds are new, and some of the worlds have themes not present in the original, such as a water world and an ice world. Don't expect any new graphics here, though. This hack is all about the level design. The game is moderately challenging, and some of the last levels can get very hard.

This is a really nice hack. I love how you started the game with assorted Super Mario Bros. retros. I thought it would have been cool if I could pick up those sprouts like in a Fake Mario 2. Nice lakitu boss and SMB3 lakitu. I'm wondering how I can make the SMB3 lakitu go away. And it would be nice if you used that custom block from STARSW.zip for the flagpole (SMB Goal Pole and Goal Block with Music (Acts like 130)). This is really short, too. Anyway, good job!

Broken Peace The galaxy once enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity. Trade lines were open, the citizens were happy and the Galactic Federation kept a watchful eye over the planets. Not long ago, that peace was broken by a startling discovery.

The Dawn of the Metroids On a routine survey mission of the planet SR388, the crew of a Galactic Federation vessel discovered a new airborne life form and gave it the name "Metroid". These creatures, which could engulf other living beings and take away their energy, proved to be strong and prolific. After just a few seconds of Beta-Ray bombardment, a single Metroid became two Metroids, and then four. Several Metroid specimens were gathered so that the survey vessel crew could take them to Galactic Federation Headquarters for further examination. As the crew sped towards headquarters, they were ambushed by space pirates from the planet Zebes. The pirates stole the Metroids and took them to their home planet, where the planet-leading Mother Brain created a Metroid force.

Enter Samus Bounty hunter Samus Aran was commissioned by the Galactic Federation to eliminate the space pirates and do away with the dangerous Metroids. Samus landed on Zebes alone and carried out her mission with speed and precision. After the skirmish on Zebes, a special corps was assigned by the Galactic Federation to destroy the Metroids on SR388. That corps was never heard from again. The Supreme Council gave Samus the job to fly to SR388 and do what the special corps could not do--make the Metroids extinct.

RETRUN TO SR388 The Metroids on SR388 were more advanced than the creatures on Zebes. These monsters could shed their skins and grow even stronger. Samus worked deep below the surface and blasted all of the Metroids in her path. Her final victory was against the enormous Metroid Queen. When the queen was defeated, Samus discovered a Metroid egg which hatched before her eyes. Even this hardened bounty hunter could not destroy the Metroid larva. When the larva sensed Samus' presence, it clung to her as though it had found its mother. Samus packed up the Metroid larva and took it with her to the Space Science Academy on the Galactic Federation Space Colony where scientists could study the creature and understand its special organic structure.

A New Discovery The Science Academy scientists found out that the energy- producing properties of the Metroid could benefit humankind. Their report suggested that the Metroids may have originally been created for peaceful purposes. Just when it seemed peace and order had been restored, Samus received an emergency directive from the Galactic Federation:

EMERGENCY! EMERGENCY! Return immediately to the Space Science Academy!

WhenSamus made her way to the research facility, she found the building in ruins and the Metroid larve was nowhere to be found. Out of the darkness came a group of Zebesian space pirates and their leader, Ridley, who had the Metroid larva in tow. The pirates fled to a rebuilt planet Zebes and Samus followed them, resolving to finish them off and save the hatchling!

--From the SNES Super Metroid instruction manual.

Overview:

Super Metroid was a great addition to the series. It had a great story, just like the other Metroid games, but with better graphics, sound, and controls. It was an absolute joy to play and made you want to keep playing all night long. This may have been the greatest Metroid game ever made. If you have played any of the Metroid games and enjoyed them, you must play Super Metroid. Good luck and have fun playing.

Directions:

Explore the caverns of Zebes searching for the last Metroid. When you first arrive on Zebes, you can't do much. As you explore, you will gain new abilities that will allow you to dive deeper into the planet.

Controls:

A Button - Jump
B Button - Run
X Button - Shoot
Y Button - Cancel/Deselect weapon
L Button - Angle Down
R Button - Angle Up
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Select Item

Tips:

Crystal Flash
This allows you to refill your Energy Tanks.
1. You must have 49 or less energy units.
2. You must have 10 or more missiles, 10 or more Super Missiles, and 11 or more Power Bombs.
3. Choose the Power Bomb icon, and morph.
4. Press and hold the L, R, and shot buttons and hold DOWN on the control pad.  You will absorb the blast and refill your energy.

Secret Attacks
First, Equip the Charge Beam and ONE other beam ability e. g. ice or wide (NOT two) Select the power Bombs but do not enter morph ball mode.  Charge your beam up and you should use one of the following secret attacks

Ice-  A shield will form around you damaging enemies you touch
Wave- Energy Balls circle you then Fire away from you in various directions
Plasma- Same as wave but with Plasma effect
Spazer- Large beams fire away from you like shrapnel This will use up one of your Power Bombs

(It may not work if you've just finished charging, give it another second)

Samus clones
First, you need the speed boots and X ray visor. This is fairly easy to pull off.

Switch to the weapon that is before the Visor. Start holding the boost button while running until you see those silhouettes of Samus. Now, still holding the boost button, switch to the X ray visor. You will stop, and you will see those silhouettes in full color, mimicking your every move.  Once you let go of the button, the silhouettes will disappear.

Murder Beam
By equipping all five beams at the game time you can kill Motherbrain pretty easily.

To equip all five beams at the same time go into the equipment screen in the Sub-Menu. You will notice that the Spazar Beam in unequipped because the Plazma Beam cancels out the Spazar. Equip the Spazar Beam (thus unequipping the Plazma Beam) then move the curser over to one of the Boot Upgrades. Hit Left and the A Button at the same time to equip the Plazma Beam. If you did it right then the letters Var should appear next to the Plazma Beam.

To complete the glitch you must first charge your beam before equiping all five beams. After your beam is charged all the way , equip all five beam the way I decribed above the fire it at say Motherbrains head (when it's laying on the ground). If you did it right then an orange orb should stay behind and constantly hit Motherbrain. Equip your beams regularly.

NOTE: This beam can crash your game if not done correctly.

Viewing the Endings

Best Ending :  Beat the game in under 3 hours 
2nd Best Ending :  Beat the game within 3: 01-10: 00 
Easiest ending :  Beat the game making sure your file has more  than 10 hours on it.

Kill Draygon in one hit
As soon as the boss fight with Draygon begins, note the four turrets firing electricity from the walls-two on either side. Before Draygon even shows up, blast away all four turrets with charge shots. See how the turrets spew out electricity after being killed? Equip the Grapple Beam and get ready to use this to your advantage.

Instead of fighting Draygon the normal way, allow him to grab you. While he's swinging you about the room, use the Grapple Beam to latch on to one of the panels on the wall that was once occupied by a turret.  The electricity will go through the Grapple Beam, through your suit, and to Draygon himself. Samus will stay locked on until Draygon dies.

Save the Zebes Critters
When you are escaping during the countdown at the very end of the game, don't go straight to your ship from Crateria's caves. Instead, go to the room where you first acquired the morph ball bombs. Inside should be the critters that helped you escape certain rooms earlier in the game. Once they leave the room, you can exit too from where you entered. Saving them will affect the ending.

Higher Jump
In Super Metroid, when you get the Gravity Suit, you can move underwater freely. However, there is a trick that you can use to jump higher underwater. First, find a location that is fully submerged in water. Try a room in Maridia or the room before Lower Norfair (the ones with filled with Lava) Next, hold the jump button. Immediately after you press it, press pause. Go to the inventory menu and switch off the gravity suit.  Hold the jump button and unpause the game. You will jump higher than normal. Use this trick to get the screw attack before the space jump.

Green Gate Glitch
This is a glitch that exploits an error in the detection of valid hits in the various green gates scattered across Zebes.

Make sure the gate's tab faces to the left, and you are on its right. Stand some distance, maybe 5-6 tiles or more, from the gate. Hold the run button and right before you reach the gate tap the jump button while simultaneously aiming up and to the left and firing a super missile. With patience and skill you will open the gate from the 'wrong' side.

Exploit this glitch to obtain the Screw Attack without facing Golden Torizo, or to obtain the Grapple Beam by an alternate path, or even beat the game without shattering the Maridian tube.

This small hack only changes the control setup for the game, to something closer to the newer GBA Metroid games. The opening Options menus have been altered to show the new controls for the game. Item pickup messages and Japanese text have not been altered however.

Control Changes

- Run is now toggleable between Run and Walk.

- Moonwalk has been deleted, and the setting is now used to toggle Auto Run.

- Aim Up is now the only aim button, 'Aimlock'. Holding it will make Samus aim at a certain angle, and aim higher or lower if you tap up or down.

- Samus also has the ability to run and aim straight up at the same time now.

- Select Item is still used to select missiles, super missiles, power bombs, or the grapple beam. It no longer selects X-ray, which now has its own button. Items that are empty can be selected, but of course will not be used. Beams can still be used at any time, even when missiles and super missiles are selected.

- Item cancel has also been removed, as it now activates the x-ray scope.

- Aim Down has become Brandish, which, when held, will toggle between Beams and the item currently selected. This is somewhat? abusable.

- Smile Beams can be charged and remain charged while you fire missiles, but you still have to wait for cooldown till you can release a charged shot, or else you'll just waste your charge.

- Powerbomb attacks are also now easy to control, just tap Brandish when you want to trigger them.

- Spinjump controls have also been improved a bit - Walljumping should be a bit easier on a d-pad, and Samus will fire in the direction you're pressing instead of just forward, if you press fire.

- The controls are configurable to ANY combination. Aim is not limited to L and R.

'Cliffhanger' has a double meaning. One is the primary focus of wall jumping.

The canonical storyline is also changed, in that there never was a M1, M2 or SM.

Nor was there ever a Mother Brain.

Just what it sounds like, a new Super Metroid level design hack. Take a look at the readme for more important info. There are some graphical kinks that were compromises with the SM code.

Savestates are recommended, as save points are pretty rare, but then, this hack is not as difficult as some of the other SM hacks released recently.

Eris goes in a bit of a different direction than the other hacks. It uses all new graphics and some crazy room design to make a very eerie, moody, and atmospheric hack. There are debilitated statues and dead trees everywhere and honestly it can feel like a Castlevania game at times. The music is hand picked for every environment (rather than most hacks where it's Norfair music for Norfair, Brinstar music for Brinstar, etc) which goes a long way towards enhancing the ambiance. The good thing about Eris is that its difficulty comes from slightly beefed up baddies rather than hard-to-traverse rooms. This streamlines exploration and makes for less headaches. Eris is a very well-done hack with some excellent, scary level design and a nice sense of progression.

Notable features

-Scary and atmospheric level design

-One all new item that wasn't in Super Metroid

-An endgame artifact hunt just like in Metroid Prime

Advanced Techniques needed

-Walljumping

-Mid-air Morph

-Double Bomb Jump

Nearly 7 months in the making, and it's finally finished. Every room has been disassembled and remade, and several areas of the planet bear no resemblance to what they once were.

Walljumping is absolutely required from the very beginning. Other techniques that are required to complete the game are "infinite" single-wall walljumping (only in a couple of places though), single bombjumping, and the midair morph. Some insane crumble block skills are also required. As with most hacks, "infinite" bombjumping is not required.

There's some early difficulty with crumble blocks but if you do have problems, you can try to abuse savestates to get through it and move on to the juicy exploration-based center.

Save states are required because of the lack of save points, they cause bad errors when inserted into this game.

"JUSTIN BAILEY  " was the famous password that allowed you to play as Samus without her armor suit in Metroid, a reward normally reserved for those who can finish the game in under three hours.

To the disappointment of many, there was no armorless Samus in Super Metroid. But this patch restores that feature- each sprite, and every graphic of Samus has been redrawn by hand to make armorless Samus playable once again.

Samus has been hired to investigate MockingBird Station.  Others have come before her, but none of them have returned.  Upon arrival the station sealed the hanger doors blocking her way out.  After scanning her systems, Samus finds that she must disable the stations power generator before she can leave.  Unfortunately the most direct route to the generator has been blocked and she must take a more roundabout path.  The only thing that she knows is that much of the station is in lock down and she will need to release bulkheads to open more of the station.  A larger bulkhead in engineering is blocking the alternate route.  Disabling the generator will destroy the station, but there is no other option.

This hack is NOT a skill based hack, hell, its not even a hard hack, its aimed at those of you have beaten Super Metroid, and want to play alittle more, but ALL those other hacks are to hard;) That being said, theres still plenty of tricky puzzles for you experts, so give this a go either way, you will not be dissapointed.  

Thanks for playing, good luck, and MOST importantly, have fun!;)

SKILLS NEEDED: Walljumping, Mid-air morphball (w/ bombing)

MISC: There are no savestations except your ship, so that means using Savestates.  I'm sorry if you don't like using them, there is a very good reason for not having them.

Tricks required to beat the game:

Mid-air Morph

Double Bomb Jump

Walljumping

Infinite Single Walljumping

This hack is about as non-linear as they come (if I'm correct) and it has the same amount of final items as the original. The difficulty of this hack is kinda on the low end, so if you want more of a challenge let me know, I might make a harder version. This is my first hack so tell me what you think!

The hack totally changes the order in which you play the game (for example, you start by collecting power bombs instead of missiles and going into the middle of brinstar).

The storyline is: After Samus' last mission to Zebes, the whole planet was destroyed and Samus assumed that she would never have to face its familiar terrain again. However, a powerful creature called Regenertron was secretly regenerating Zebes in every detail, as the space pirate Ridley asked him to. Regenertron was able to recreate everything on Zebes, but not quite as it was before. He was also able to recreate the Space Colony and the friendly Metroid from SR-388. Samus did not realise this was going on as she was on a mission to investigate an all new type of Metroid that had just been discovered. However, it was a fake and then Samus received a distress signal she knew all too well. CERES STATION WAS UNDER ATTACK!!

Super Morph's plot is of a child who is given a temporary ability to change between states of Solid, Liquid, Gas coming in the forms of a cannonball,a rubber ball, a water droplet, and a cloud. The player must go through over 36 challenging levels set in 4 different zones collecting special cogs from each level in order to fix a machine capable of turning him back into a normal boy.

Gameplay:

Before playing takes place there is a cutscene of a young boy outside his uncle's house. Once the boy goes inside the house, a scientist lets the boy try out his new machine which can allow him to change state. The machine works but something goes wrong and the machine explodes sending most of its parts everywhere. The boy must now using his new abilities go around all areas of his uncle's property and find all the missing cogs.

When the game starts, the player has a choice of which area to start in. The choices are: Laboratory, Garden, Sewer or Factory. There are 12 levels in each stage, each get harder as you go along. There are also hazards for each of the forms you change into: the rubber ball will inflate when it touches spikes, the bowling ball will burn when exposed to fire, the water drop will sink when in liquid, and the cloud can be sucked in by fans. The objective for each level is to find a cog which is hidden somewhere in the level. Once you have found all 36 cogs the uncle can fix the machine and Morph can change back to his normal form, a boy.

Super Ninja Boy (Super Chinese World in Japan) is an action role-playing game released for the Super NES. It features random encounters with side-scrolling battles, although some boss battles are fought with a traditional menu-based system. There are also a few platforming sections.

In single player mode, the main character is Jack. The game can be switched between single player and multiplayer at will, with the second player controlling Ryu. Jack and Ryu share statistics, so one character never overpowers the other.

Super Ninja Boy features a password system to record progress.

It is a sequel to Culture Brain's previous title, Little Ninja Brothers for the NES.

Gameplay:

Super Ninja Boy combines classic console role-playing game elements with action game elements. The player controls the main character Jack (or two players can control both Jack and Ryu) through several locations, including towns and caves. There is an overworld map, a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, with all the towns and dungeons on it that spans several continents. There are also side-scrolling platforming areas that the player must complete as well.

Combat:

The player randomly encounters enemies on the world map and in dungeons. The player will then choose to "bout" or "run". Escape is not always guaranteed. In side-scrolling battles, the player can jump, punch, throw enemies, use items such as the ninja star, or techniques such as the super jump. Some boss battles are fought in a turn-based classic RPG style.

In the game the drivers compete against each other or the computer in racing around several top-view indoor off-road truck tracks of increasing difficulty. Good results earn the player points to continue in the championship and money with which to upgrade their truck or buy more nitro boosters. The goal is to reach the end of the season with the most money earned. Continues are available but whereas players can get extra money in the arcade version, in the home versions, the player's money is reset to 0. This is one of the first games where the player could upgrade his or her vehicle by earning points or money (although in Atari Games' Sprint series, one could upgrade their racer using wrenches), a system that is used in most arcade-style racing games today.

Licensing:

The Super NES version was notable for prominently featuring the Toyota brand; the name and logo were displayed on various tracks, and pre-race music was inspired by the "I love what you do for me Toyota" jingle that was used by the company's marketing campaign at the time of the game's release. This version also lacked any licensing or reference to Ivan Stewart, replacing him instead with the late Mickey Thompson in the gray truck.

Tips:

Slow opponent
The CPU driver will drive much slower if you input the same initials assigned to that driver.

Never finish 4th place again.
Plug in both controllers, and start a 2 player game. When you start racing, the blue truck will sit idle, for it is controlled by the 2nd player. Therefore, you can always finish 3rd or better and be able to go onto the next event.

It's a simulated pinball table, pretty simple concept really. Use the flippers to keep the ball in play. Try to aim for certain targets on the board for extra points, extra balls, etc. When things go wrong, throw a fit, scream a lot, and blame video game physics.

Directions:

Choose between three different tables: Jolly Joker, Blackbeard and Ironmen, and Wizard. Each has a different setting and layout. There are two different game modes: Competition, which is a single game, and Conquest, a tournament game which makes you play through each table one after another.

Controls:

A Button - Activates right flipper
B Button - Launches ball
X Button - Tilt
Y Button - No use
L Button - Activates left flipper
R Button - Activates right flipper
Start Button - Starts game, pause/unpause

Tips:

999,999,000 points and lets you see the end of the game

In the Password screen enter CRUSHEND and then you'll receive 999,999,000 points.  Score more 900 points and you will also be able to see the end of the game.

Super Play Action Football is an American football video game developed by Nintendo for the Super NES. It is the follow up to NES Play Action Football.

Although not lacking in quality game play, it was commercially unsuccessful as it faced fierce competition from competitors such as Electronic Arts' Madden NFL series

The goal of the game is to obtain the ball and reach the other end of the field to score a touchdown, while avoiding opponent players who can pile onto the character possessing the ball. If the opponent players do manage to pile onto the character holding the ball, the play stops and the team goes back to the previous line. A quirk in the gameplay allows the defensive player to get an easy sack if they dive with the nose tackle at the precise moment the ball is snapped.

Tips:

Super Play Action Football

Guaranteed Blocked PAT
There is a glitch on the PAT that will allow you to block the kick each and every time your opponent goes for one after the touchdown.

Have your player line up over the center before the snap. When the holder shouts 'Ready, ' press down and the Y button to jump over the line of scrimmage. If you do this correctly, you will be between the center and the holder. Do not touch anyone yet, as you get an off sides penalty.

When the holder shouts 'Set', press the START button, which brings you to the pause screen that shows the score, quarter, etc. Wait for one second and press the START button again. You will still be in between the center and the holder, but the game doesn't acknowledge your presence! This makes the kick easy pickings now. When the ball is snapped, wait for the ball to pass through you and into the holders hands.  You should easily be able to press Y again to jump onto the holder and snuff the kick.

Developer: System 3
Publisher: U.S. Gold
Players: 1
_________________________

Putty Moon, the place where all the putties live, has been taken over by an evil wizard named Dazzledaze. Putty has been banished from the moon to the planet below. To return to Putty Moon and oust the evil wizard, Putty enlists the help of some robots ("bots") to build a skyscraper that will reach up to Putty Moon.

Gameplay:

In Putty, the player controls a blue blob with eyes. Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a "smart bomb", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process.

Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.

Putty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities.

A final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still.

The levels in Putty are laid out vertically, with the screen scrolling up and down. The levels contain regular platforms, as well as "solid" ledges that Putty can not move through, and other special tiles including electric platforms and bounce pads.

The aim of each level is to rescue a set number of bots within the time limit. In the early sections of the game, the bots simply stand around the level. Putty has to absorb them, and carry them to the level's goal (either a flying saucer or an elevator). Later on in the game, the bots will jump around platforms, often falling to their death.

Invariably each level also contains various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies will attempt to hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks from some of the enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player to have to find another bot to absorb.

Putty is also able to use powerups that are scattered around each level. These range from simple points bonuses to temporary invulnerability, to Uncle Ted. Once this latter powerup is collected, a man with a Hammond Organ name Uncle Ted appears, and proceeds to play a tune, causing all of the enemies in the level to freeze.

Tips:

Super Putty

Stage Skip
Pause the game, then press R, A, L, L, Y. Now you can skip to the end of any stage by pressing SELECT.

Super Puyo Puyo Tsuu is a Matching Puzzle game, developed and published by Compile, which was released in Japan in 1995.

Tips:

Best ending
In normal Puyo Puyo mode, have at least 180 000 experience and don't use any continue to fight Masked Satan after Rulue instead of Satan. Defeat him to view the best ending.

Custom menu
In the options, enter game mode and let the cursor on exit game mode 10-15 seconds. Instead of the description, there will be a message saying 'Huh?  You've discovered the secret area. Now you can access the custom menu. '. Quit game mode and now you can enter custom, which allows you to limit the colors of the puyo puyo and watch a match between CPU.

Easy win with high experience
In the custom menu, limit the colors of Puyo Puyo to 2 (put color minus to 3). Now try to fight the CPU and make disappear all the puyo puyo on your side of the field as quickly as possible, it sends 4 lines of garbage puyo to the opponent. It becomes far easier to win because the CPU is slow to clear his field and you will earn more than 20 000 experience after each fight.

PS: In the first fights in normal puyo puyo, there seems to be only one color of puyo so you just have to press down and wait some time, the CPU always loses.

This is a review that, honestly, does not need to be written. Basically, everyone who could ever hope to love a series like Super Robot Wars already knows about it. It's a mecha fanboy's wetdream; it brings together mecha from all these different anime into one universe, and has them fight each other in pretty wicked little fight animations. What's the official SRW3 count? Gundam 0079, Char's Counterattack, Gundam 0080, Gundam 0083, Z Gundam, ZZ Gundam, Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, UFO Robo Grendizer, Yuusha Raideen, Getta Robo, Daitarn 3, Choudenji Robo ComBattler V, and the Masoukishin originals. Whatever those are.

I'll be blunt here. This is a nice, decent strategy RPG, but if you're like most non-Japanese who have never even heard of most of those series, then you simply won't enjoy the game. Which is also why you will never, ever, see these games outside of Japan. This is a game made by fanboys for fanboys, and anyone who falls into that category will absolutely adore it. Have fun, you crazy guys you!

Translation Description:

Everything's complete, except for (of course) a few tiny bugs. Play the game!

Tips:

Sound Test
During any scenario, go to an empty square and press A (menu button), third-last option (SYSTEM), press A (confirm), and go to third option (SOUND).  Then, Hold SELECT then press A

Tips:

Neo Granzon
Once you've completed Masaki's and Ryuune's route, your save file should have the letters 'MR' meaning Masaki
and Ryuune. Restart the game and on the Banpresto starting blue screen press 'Down, Up, Left, Right, L, R' before the screen fades. It should turn pink and when you start Shuu's route, you will start with Neo Granzon instead of a regular Granzon.

Super Scope 6
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Super Scope
Genre: Light Gun , Shooter
Players: 1
_________________________
*
Super Scope 6 was the game the was most often bundled with the Super Scope. It is played purely using the Super Scope, and unlike Duck Hunt, has several other features, including turbo fire and many varying games wrapped into one. The Super Scope was meant to bring the light gun into the next generation. Though it never gained in popularity, probably due to its size, it still produced great games and carried the light gun further on. This bundled game is no exception!

This game is actually two in one, which then turns into almost a six in one, and then into almost twelve to eighteen in one, with many variations of each game and several different modes! This left me with a sigh of relief. Thank goodness, I wasn't going to have to play the same game repeatedly, shooting the same stuff again and again.

I was then taken back a bit, because every different mode is basically a disguised same mode. They are just masked versions of the same game. Different, same, either way you don't feel bored or tired of playing the same game with a different feature.

Using the Super Scope (mouse, of course, on the emulator) just feels natural, and no longer having to remember and execute complex combinations or other buttons is a plus.

Though each of the games/levels starts out easy and slow, the game play can be increasingly difficult and frenetic and very fun! Bring along a friend (using a controller or another mouse) and the fun is enhanced as you're both shooting toward the same goal!

The graphics are pretty good for being a small game and take full advantage of the SNES. Yet they feel way too cartoony for such a gun-like device and I would have liked to see at least one more instance of a military style game. The sound feels the same way, a bit too jumpy. The gun sound will get very repetitive and annoying.

My only other complaint is the fact that the bullets are delayed in every game, leaving some of the faster levels impossible to react and shoot fast enough; also always having to lead your targets is a bit annoying. Good thing is, your gun is very very accurate and you'll have no instance when you are off target! If you enjoy shooting games or like light guns, this game is for you!

I give Super Scope 6    7 bullets out of 10!     Happy Shooting!

Directions:

Depending on which game you select, directions differ. In either case you'll have to calibrate your aim and test your shot. Your choices for games are:

Blastris: - An action oriented, Block-shooting, Tetris.

Blastris A, plays like the original Tetris! Pieces, instead of falling down the screen, fall from left to right. You can't rotate the pieces, but rather shoot specific tiles so they fit. As usual, when a row, or in this case column, is filled it will disappear. Meet the goal and advance through each level, growing in difficulty!

Blastris B, is a bit different.

In Type A your task is to clear the tiles already presented to you. In order to do this you must make three or more tiles touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, not unlike Columns. Type B Plays in the same method, except you're given no original rows!

Mole Patrol is Whack'A'Mole...... on the MOON! You are to shoot these fast moving critters in a hurry. Either to rack up a high score per level, or rack up a set score!

Secondly there is...

Lazer Blazer - A futuristic military game, set for you to win for your country!

Intercept, 1 or 2 players, has you shooting varying missiles for a range in score depending on its speed, shape, and length. Blow them out of the air to make sure that no more than 5 missiles meet their target, otherwise you lose. Lead the targets so that your missile has time to intercept!

Engage which has several difficulty settings, each uniquely difficult, has you flying to defend your ship and base from enemies in a very F-Zero feeling world. Your mission is to take out the set enemy units in the area and work your score up to the next wave. Try not to take too much damage or you can kiss your ship goodbye!

Confront, also only with varying, but unique levels, has you stay on a base turret and take the enemies' mechs head-on. This mode is completely identical to Engage, except you're not moving and targets are a bit more random and fast. 

Controls:

Activate Super Scope When the game loads press Esc. Go to Config and click Add-Ons then Super Scope. Your cursor will change to a crosshair and you're ready to fire!

Hints:

Lead your Target
Remember that the bullet is delayed and will travel in a 3-D like environment. Shoot accordingly! 

Tips:

Invincibility in Lazer Blazer Game
Use a controller and tap X repeatedly until you get hit five times. Then replace the Super Scope and play

"Ugh..."

There are no two ways around this fact: This game sucks. Period.

Shadow of the Beast is a platform shooter (more platform than shoot, though) for the SNES released in 1992 by Psygnosis. The Psygnosis name got me to try it, but it didn't keep me around for long.

The title screen is fairly cool. It mixes Gangsta Graffiti style text with some sort of ancient Egyptian... glyphical... things. It looks nice, but it has nothing to do with the game itself, as far as I can see.

See, you're actually a demon. Well, in the continue screen (which you'll see a lot), you look like one. In the gameplay, you look like a bluish gray hunchbacked critter that may or may not be a duck with his bill on backwards.

The game's graphics are excellent. Definitely a cut above, considering that it was only released in 1992. Characters are well animated when they walk around, punch you, kick you, shoot you, kill you, and when you die. However, it seems Psygnosis got a bit lazy, as most of the enemies die simply by falling off of the screen Koopa-style. They also fall off the screen if you dive down a ladder while they're attacking you, which makes for some comical escapades when a half dozen bats rain down every time you go up or down a level in a dungeon.

However, these animations make for a handicap. There's about a half-second delay when you try to turn around before you can start running. Most enemies are just as fast as you (some are faster), so if you have to turn around to get some breathing room, you're already dead. Your jumping power is tantalizingly weak, and usually leaves you a pixel short of where you want to jump to, forcing you instead to spend thirty minutes going in a wide circle and fighting five or six nearly unbeatable bosses in the interim.

Although most enemies die in one shot (be it a punch, a kick, or whatever), some of them are insane. For example, there are lots of bats in trees in the game. The bats sit in trees until you're under them, then all fifty of them fly around in bizarre acrobatic circles. You cannot get past them without getting hit, because they literally come down in waves that leave the only passable gap tantalizingly outside of your (very weak) jumping power.

These bats seem to be physically impervious to all forms of damage. Punch them, they hurt you. Kick them, they hurt you. So you go find your gun - it looks like an interesting crossbreed between an alien death ray and a roll of paper towels - and come back. Lo and behold, you can shoot them all day and only kill a few. Not that your gun can shoot all day. See, there's a number after the picture of the gun on the screen, but that number doesn't change as you fire. When your ammo runs out for no apparent reason, you can't help but ask yourself what that number means. You also can't switch back to your punch attack once you get the gun, so you can't save ammo for real fights.

These bats really got to me. Let me explain the video game monster hierarchy to you here: Demon beats Bat. Even if that demon is a blue demon who thinks he's a duck and the bat is really big (which the bats in this game aren't; they're normal, bite-sized bats), demon always beats bat. The fact that the demon has an alien death ray pretty much seals the deal. That's just the way the world works. In fact, bats are the at the bottom level of the video game food chain, along with rabbits and houseplants.

As you progress through the game, you gain powers by beating strong enemies, then lose and regain them for no apparent reason for the duration. After defeating one boss, I found I could hurl electric death from my hands, and actually kill those stupid bats for a while. However, just as I needed that electric death, I had my gun back for some reason. When it ran out of ammo, I didn't have my electric attack anymore. When I went through a door, I could suddenly shoot little tornado-like objects.

The best part of the game has to be the Continue screen. It emphasizes all the things the game does, right and wrong. Every time you die, you see the most beautifully rendered screen in the game: Your broken demon (you actually look like a demon here) body, with the Shadow of what I suppose is the titular Beast passing over you. I never got to see the Beast, but his Shadow looks somewhat like a pterodactyl-ish dinosaur. For all I know, it could just be one of those invincible bats.

The continue screen also has the string ''CONTINUE: 9'' on it. What does the 9 mean? Nothing. It's not a countdown, because it doesn't count down. It's not how many continues you have, because you actully have around 5.

The game just isn't fun. If you really want to play a demon, pick up a game like Demon Crest. It's actually fun. Shadow of the Beast has great graphics, but gameplay is crippled by controls that feel like you're in full-body cast and downright lousy design. Too many oversights (the non-functional ammo counter, the mysterious 9 on the Continue screen), and too many no-win situations. Nothing in the game can be called interesting or compelling by any measure of the words.

Nothing I can say about this game will adequately capture just how bad this game sucks. I would only recomend you play this game only if you want to fully understand how not fun it is.

To make matters worse, the SNES cartridges just don't make good paperweights or doorstops. Super Shadow of the Beast has no reason for existence.

If you see this game cheap, it costs too much. If you see this game free, it's not worth it. If it's free and comes with candy, use your own judgment, but that better be pretty good candy.

16 of the worlds best soccer teams have come together to have a tournament! Take control of one of the teams and burst your way through big, bad soccer players!

I'm not much of a soccer fan, but this game had me glued to my seat. It's one hard game. And when I say hard, I mean "Sit down and do this math test" hard. But there's a lot of cool stuff besides the tournament. Like shootout mode and a cool intro animation. 

Directions:

The object is to use your team to kick a ball around and get it into your opponent's net. your opponent is trying to do the same to you. The person who scores the most points wins. If there's a tie, a shootout happens. 5 shots go. If the score is tied after the balls have been shot, it keeps going until the score evens out.

Controls:

A Button - Passes, cancels
B Button - Selects, shoots
X Button - Nothing

Hints:

The player must first choose one of eight national football teams, followed by a star player from a choice of four available for each team. In the game a win is needed to progress to the next game. A draw will end as a 'game over', with no option for penalties, but a chance to continue by restarting the game in which a win was not achieved. Each opposition team is chosen according to a tier strategy, with the player's team removed:

1. Spain and France.
2. Netherlands and Brazil.
3. England and Italy.
4. Argentina and Germany.

Thus, playing with Germany, the first two games will be Spain or France in some order, the second two games will be Netherlands in Brazil in some order, the third two games will be England and Italy in some order, and the seventh game will be Argentina. The game is completed when all seven other teams have been beaten. The level of difficulty increases the further you progress. In addition, the game notices when individual team players score a hat trick. Scoring hat tricks has the effect of increasing the difficulty as well.

The game gained some notoriety for giving you the ability to use violence (including punches, flying kicks and shirt pulling). You could get away with this without giving away a free kick as long as the referee was either far enough or knocked onto the floor. The referee punishes every foul with a yellow card. Red cards occur at the third, seventh, and eleventh fouls, although every so often the game appears to miscount. No fourth red card is given by the referee. Besides the rough play, the game introduced the super shot, which occurs with 30 seconds remaining or less and when the score is tied or the player is losing by 1 goal. The star player chosen kicks a shot that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands.

Tips:

Ace Striker Team
At the title screen press Up, X, Left, Y, Right, A, Down, B, Left, Up, Right, Down, Select, and Start.

Are you ready for extreme action and awesome storyline? Are you ready for guns blazing and swords flashing? Are you really looking for all that in a game called Super Solitaire? Oh, you are.... sorry, you're in the wrong place. This is the classic card game made into a console video game. What better way to pass the time than to sit down and place cards overtop of each other. Have fun!

Super Solitaire is a classic game that anyone can play. The graphics of this are alright given the fact that there isn't any action or scrolling backgrounds. The music is mediocre when it's playing, but for the most part you are sitting in silence.

Directions:

Super Solitaire is a simple game that anyone can play, simply place the cards in numerical order with alternating color suits, black red black red or visa versa. In the top right of the screen is where you place your aces, then you start the whole thing over again going up in number instead of down. On the top left of the screen is the deck you draw from. Flip the cards over one or three at a time and use the card that is on top. In the menu you can change the number of draws or the number of cards that are flipped at one time. From the menu you can also restart the game, get help, or quit. So instead of paying for a deck of cards (which is what, like 50 cents?), you can sit down and play it on the game screen. Because, lets face it, if you wanted poker or gambling, you would be playing Super Caesar's Palace.

The Empire Strikes Back

It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy.

Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth.

The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space....

Change Intro
On the Game Start, Option, and Password screen, press Y four times. If entered correctly, you will hear a tone.
Select 'Game Start' and press Start. Wait for the title 'Star Wars' to fade off. Then, when the introduction comes on, use the Control Pad and L and R to rotate and scroll the words around the screen. You can also move the Star Destroyer around, too. That is all the code does.

Sound Test
At any time during stages where you control one of the heroes (not during stages where you control a vehicle IE snow speeder or spaceship), press and hold down the following buttons: A, B, X, Y and Down. While holding these, press Start to access a Sound Test. Use Left and Right to cycle through the tunes, press A to select the desired tune and listen to it.  While still playing the selected tune, you can press Start to resume game play. Whatever tune you selected in the Sound Test will be playing in place of the stage's normal music! In effect, you could be in the middle of say, stage one with the boss theme or the ending theme playing instead of the Imperial March! Remember, on stages where you pilot vehicles this code will not work.

_________________________

Super Street Fighter II was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1994. The 16-bit console versions included additional game modes such as Group Battle, Tournament Battle and Time Challenge, as well as adjustable game speed.

Tips:

Different Color Outfits!
To get different color outfits for the characters use different buttons to select them.

Edit buttons right before a fight
To edit what button does what right before a fight, simply hold select sometime before the versus screen appears, and do whatever you would normally do, until the edit screen appears. This should work in any mode, and in versus mode you can even select if either player should be CPU, or human }Reach M. Bison(Vega) without fighting CPU Select Arcade Mode normally. When you start your fight press START on the controller 2. Then select for the second player the same fighter the CPU was using and beat it. You will see yourself in the second fight!  Repeat this until you find M. Bison(Vega) and fight for your life!

Select the 8th outfit
When you select your fighter, press and hold all 3 punches or all 3 kicks until the outfit changes color.

Use Up to 8 of Each Fighter in Group Battle
Group Battle usually limits you to two instances of each fighter, but this code increases that number to eight.

From the Game Start screen, enter Group Battle mode.  Then, using the second controller, alternately and repeatedly tap L and R until Vega laughs. Choose Match Play or Elimination from the menu. You and your opponent will now be able to use up to eight instances of each fighter.

View Character Profiles
When you start the game wait for the first profile and hold:  L + R on 2P

_________________________

In Super Strike Eagle, the player controls a pilot for the United Nations. The player's objective is to bring various governments around the world back into cooperation with the UN. Each time a military campaign against a certain regime is completed, the flag of the nation in question is again raised at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, New York, United States of America. The storyline begins with a practice round and then continues to progress. Targets become progressively difficult to destroy. Unlike most shooter games, the player only has one plane. If the player crashes, the game is over and a screen indicating the nations (if any) that were reclaimed by the player displays.

There are various types of targets in the game, including air, land and water targets. Land targets include nuclear power plants (but often include anti-air weapons and tanks); the player may suffer from radiation sickness after destroying nuclear plants when not at a safe distance to do so. The player will eventually need to use one of his/her limited sorties to have it healed; neglecting to do so will have fatal results. Weapons in the game include guns, missiles, electronic jammers, and bombs. Each mission on every war theatre consists of both mandatory and optional targets.[4]

Shooting the optional targets results in the accumulation of a higher score which can double as a respect meter for bragging rights. Furthermore, destroying airfields, although not necessarily required to complete a mission, would stop opposing fighters taking-off to take the player down. Although the game cannot be saved through a video game battery, there are a number of passwords the player can use to resume his/her mission at the appropriate place. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Japan approximately simultaneously. All three versions of this game use the English language for both text and speech and offer identical game play to each other.

Arcade platform game, based on the license of those bright-haired cute naked chaps. Each scrolling level was initially shrouded in an animated "mist". Large rectangles of mist could be cleared by running around platforms and ladders in the correct order. As the mist cleared, a brightly-coloured background was revealed. All the usual platform enemies and pickups abounded.

Suzuka 8 Hours allows the player to virtually participate in the grueling eight-hour long Suzuka race in Japan. While the game doesn't allow the player to play for 8 real hours (even in the Japanese Super Famicom version), he can play for 8 "virtual hours", which is translated to over 1? hours of "real time." The player controls a motorcycle on a closed race track intended for motorized two-wheel vehicles. The object is to complete as many laps as you can before time runs out. If time runs out, the clock starts going up again (as penalty time) and the next trip to the finish line ends the race.

S.W.A.T Kats is a game based on the short lived cartoon series S.W.A.T Kats: Radical Squadron. The series would only last for 2 seasons but built a sort of cult following afterwards.

The Swat Kats are a trio of mechanics by day, but secretly also a group of superheroes defending their home, MegaKat city, from creatures and evil villians. Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.

Sylvester and Tweety was in development by Visual Concepts by October 1993, as indicated by this short demo. This demo consists of one short scene with Sylvester and Tweety roaming around the room, and another demonstration of the character art.

According to Rene Boutin, a producer at Sunsoft, a one level demo was shown at CES or E3 around 1994 and 1995. In the demo, you controlled Sylvester. The game was advertised in a Sunsoft advertisement in 1995, though it is unknown how close it was to completion. When Sunsoft of America went under, most games that were near completion were sold to Acclaim, so it is unlikely this game was ready for release.

"A dark, brooding game packed with good old fashioned fun"

Syndicate is a big-time favourite game for me, it is filled with mayhem, destruction, cool weaponry and scary music. Yet another bullfrog masterpiece, this one was severely under-rated (at least in my area)

Syndicate doesn't have the most complex of storylines. It is the future and you are the head of a syndicate, a massive company/mafia group/government that pretty much rules like a dictatorship. You pretty much want to take over the world, and several other syndicates out their have the same idea.

You start the game with 8 specially designed cyborgs. You are able to inject them with drugs to increase or decrease speed, accuracy and strength during the game and replace organs and limbs after and before each mission. As you get more taxes from the regions you takeover you can research new weapons and new upgrades to the cyborg's bodies. As you increase their normal, puny human body to complicated machinery they will become stronger, tougher and smarter. It is a real blow later on in the game to lose a cyborg you've spent millions of dollars on believe me!

Each mission generally involves assassinating people, or maybe persuading certain political figures to your viewpoint (with the handy brain-scrambling persuadatron). Often you will find rival syndicated pursuing the same goals as you and you must kill or be killed to continue. The music flares up dramatically whenever you encounter a rival cyborg, and it can be quite frightening when you don't quite know where they are then BAM you're hit with a rocket launcher from out of the blue. Gripping stuff.

The missions all have a few paragraphs describing the reason as to why your killing this person or why your persuading that person and they are often quite humorous to read. My favorite mission would probably be the one where you must destroy every single civilian because they've all contracted the plague!

The graphics are quite sharp, with many varied terrain. The games stays true to the theme at all times, offering a gritty harsh futuristic world. You can jump into cars (which follow a set track) which are very fun to ride around in, running people over, etc. The games only problem is with indoor areas. Rather than fading away the roof or sending you into another screen you must navigate your men by using the tiny mini-map near the bottom of the screen, otherwise you are running blind. This can be particularly annoying when there are enemy agents or police bots inside!

Still, this game is very entertaining. It's humour is the traditional bullfrog quirkiness, which many people love. I highly recommend it to anybody who can actually find a copy.

The story of the game falls in line with the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day: to save the leader of the Human Resistance, John Connor, and his mother, Sarah, from the T-1000, a mimetic poly-alloy Terminator, bent on killing them both.

The first mission is actually a backstory on what happened before the T-800 and the T-1000 entered Skynet. It also showed some of Skynet's machines that didn't appear in the film (for example, the Silverfish).

Running on the once-popular Williams/Midway Y-Unit arcade hardware, the 2 players essentially take part in controlling a T-800 model and gun down the terminators of the opposing side in a light gun style fashion, even though the controller was technically a joystick. The gameplay utilizes a first-person perspective, like the rest of the games in the genre, but what was noteworthy about T2 was the use of digitized actors from footage specially shot during the making of the film. This made for realistic 2D sprites in a Light gun game for the time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robert Patrick, and Eddie Furlong all reprised their respective roles for the making of the arcade game. Linda Hamilton did not lend her likeness as Sarah Connor in any footage of the game; she is instead played by Debbie Evans.

In the demo sequence, the game has been rated "R" (for Righteous) by the Motion Picture Gaming Association of America.

In the original coin-op version of the game, if one presses the Player-1 or Player-2 'Start' button without any credits being available, a sample of Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice will say "No way, Jose!"

If you're one of those lame kiddies who think that graphics make a good RPG, well you're going to like Tales of Phantasia. If you're everybody else, and you know that gameplay is also important to a good RPG, well you're going to like Tales of Phantasia. This is one of the games developed by the god-company tri-Ace, back when they still worked for Namco and stuff. They're the same folks who made Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile, and the same things that made those games badass are at work in this one: awesome graphics, and a kickass game to back it up, with a different and innovative combat system. If you can't tell, I like this game a lot. Describing the battle system is difficult.. I've frequently heard it referred to as sort of a fighting game, but that's completely wrong. It allows for a lot more strategy and movement than most games, but you really have to see it for yourself. A is to attack, B is to use a special technique, Y is to change your targeting, and X brings up the menu.

Sure, the AI's dumber than a rock, and it's annoying when you're trying to fight a Harpy and you're just standing there slashing at air, but it's more fun than you're likely to have from doing something else. And that's what's important.

Tips:

Hard Mode
In the title screen, highlight New game and press A, B, Y and X on the controller at the same time. You will hear 'Ya ta!' upon doing so, indicating you've done it right.

Taloon's Great Adventure
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Shoot 'em Up , Side-Scrolling
Release Year: 2004
Original Title: Torneko no Daibouken: Fushigi no Dungeon
Translated By: Magic Destiny
Version: 0.99
_________________________
*
This is the first in the long, varied series of Chunsoft's Mysterious Dungeon (or if you're a prude, Fushigi no Dungeon) series. All of the games in the series have one thing in common: lots and lots of dungeon crawling. I've never actually played Rogue, keep in mind, but it's hard to imagine this being anything different. You run around in a series of randomly generated dungeons, consisting of lots of rooms connected by small corridors. Randomly generated dungeons at their finest, here! And you fight monsters, and collect all manner of randomly generated treasure, and do it lots and lots of times.

This game involves Taloon (or Torneko, if you played its Playstation sequel, Torneko: The Last Hope (or the nonexistent English-language Dragon Warrior IV for Playstation)) leaving his home of Endor in search of fantastic treasures and whatnot. He eventually reaches the Mysterious Dungeon, and decides to poke around for a bit. And there you have it.

Translation Description:

This project started a long long time ago, with oRdErEDchaos and Wildbill. It changed hands a lot of times, over to Taskforce and then to necrosaro, and went through quite a lot of translation headaches, but the end result is pretty damn pleasant.

This is an unofficial release by necrosaro, and has not been approved by anyone at Magic Destiny, mostly cause no one knows where the hell they are. Wildbill wanted to hold off on a full release until everything was finished, most notably the intro text formatting and some graphics, but keep in mind the last patch release we saw from this was over three years ago. So necro wisely decided to just release it anyways.

All the horrible script formatting (or rather, lack of) has been fixed in this release, making it one hundred percent playable now. Like I said, the only problems are with the intro text, some graphics, and some other little things. Who cares! Go and play.

By the way, Wildbill's script edit is awesome.

The plot for the game is a twist on the usual "Save the world" stereotype for many platform games. One evening, Taz's father is telling an intriguing tale. Somewhere on Tazmania is a Lost Valley, and in that valley nests a huge seabird, so huge that one of its eggs could feed a family for a year. Taz becomes fascinated by the prospect of the potentially large omelette and leaves in search of one of those eggs. However in his haste he leaves before his Dad has finished the story and thus does not know exactly where to go. The player must direct Taz through 5 stages in search of the Lost Valley and its Giant Bird.

Tips:

The main character Ray and his party of Aqutallion warriors quest to find and destroy Homncruse, the evil power threatening their world. Ray begins his journey alone on a tiny island, but eventually he meets his friends and fellow Aqutallion Warriors, Tina, Cody, Leona, and Dan, and even creates a town for the victims of Homncruse's evil to live. Villains encountered along tend to range from comical, such as Cat Boo and Badbad with his lackeys the Badmen, to the elite generals of evil of Homncruse, Dram, Booth, Gara, and Godem.

Initially all the teens are considered Pennon, the lowest rank of warrior. Before they can destroy Homncruse each of them must undergo a trial at their respective temples hidden around the world to receive the secondary powers of Banalet. Dan is an exception because he is the descendant of the prosperous Wise Man clan of Aqutallion. When Ray, Tina, Cody, and Leona achieve the status of Banalet and are united by the powers of Dan, Aqutallion is reborn and the group gains incredible powers.

The Aqutallions are not alone. 11 members of Kustera can be recruited to fight for the young warriors in their place for a time being. The Kustera are mostly meant to serve as a supplement to the Aqutallions, but their role in the story is vital to its progression. From the same temples where the Aqutallions gain their Banalet status, there is a Kustera only warp icon that sends the group to a dungeon where great treasures are hidden.

Gameplay:

The battle system follows the traditional RPG battle system where the party trades blows with opponents in simple turn-based fashion, the player selecting all commands for the following round of combat and then watching the results, such as in the Dragon Quest games. Play switches between two parties throughout the game. Certain areas are inaccessible without the right party.

Tips:

Optional Kustera members
Several Kusteras are found throughout the game that are not normally obtained through the main story. Here is
how to get them.  

Ben
In Decatas, talk to the woman in the rightmost house  in the group of three. Find Ben in the nearby bar in the main district.

Evelyn 
In Elekees, find her in a house near the entrance.

Ryu 
After defeating Badbad and using the Dogpill, he  is in a house in Beegees. Talk to him and he will join.

Shark 
After getting Dan, find Shark in the house southwest  of Bonzley.

Max money for Kustera
On some game files, you are able to obtain max money for Kustera! First, you must be at Decatas with your Aqutallion party (ideally, right after Morgan gets you into the town). Swap to the Kustera party, and walk to Decatas, but DO NOT FIGHT IN ANY BATTLES. If you encounter an enemy, run away. When you get to Decatas, use Morgan's hole to get inside, then walk inside the building with Uncle Save. Talk to the other person behind the counter, and they will offer to bribe the guards away from the front gate. Ordinarily, this will cost 1000G, but on some occasions, no money will be deducted but the guards will still be gone, and on other occasions, Kustera will be left with 9, 999, 999G! It does not always work, so do not worry if it does not work for you the first time you try it.

Tecmo Super Baseball features all 28 MLB teams that existed at the time. However, the only license the game has is the MLBPA license. This means that while the game does feature actual players, there are no team names or logos. The teams wear uniforms without logos and are only named by their city (the teams that share the cities of Chicago and New York are separated by having either an A or N after their name, denoting their league).

Modes

Pre-Season:

This is a single exhibition game between any two teams. The player can face the computer, play against another player, or let the computer go at it. In addition, there is the coach option, which allows the player to act as a manager. In this mode, the player selects what kind of pitches will be thrown and what kind of batting swings will be taken, but then lets the computer execute the actions.

Season:

The player selects the status of all 28 teams (play, coach, watch, or skip) and goes through a complete season (the schedule is based on the 1993 season), ending with the playoffs and finally the World Championship Series. Along the way, stats are kept for every team and player in the league.

Super Stars:

A game can be played between the Super Star teams (a copyright-free name for the All-Star teams). Players can use either the All-Star teams from 1993 or draft their own team.

Team Data:

Here, players can view all of the players' statistics from 1993, as well as their statistics for the game's current season, if one is in progress.

Genre: Sports , Football
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Tecmo
Publisher: Tecmo
_________________________
*
After the initial success of Tecmo Bowl, Tecmo followed up with the release of Tecmo Super Bowl in 1991. The original Tecmo Bowl was licensed by the National Football League Players Association, while NFL Football for NES managed to obtain only a team license. Tecmo Super Bowl added the NFL license making it the first NES game to feature both actual NFL teams and players of the time. Also unlike the original Tecmo Bowl, which had twelve teams, Tecmo Super Bowl features all 28 teams. In 1997, both Electronic Gaming Monthly and IGN, video game publications, named TSB one of the top 100 video games of all time.

Tecmo Super Bowl is still played today. There are national tournaments around the country. More info can be found on www.knobbe.org and www.tecmo.us . Tecmo Super bowl is also played online using Emulators and Roms. There are over 100 players online who participate in leagues, tournaments, and pick-up games. You can play with the original rosters, updated, past, college and many other rosters available. 

Gameplay and Features:

Every team in TSB was modeled after a real life NFL franchise. The teams used the same logos and the same city affiliations used by the NFL. As in real life, each team had its own offensive playbook, but unlike real life the defense must simply be chosen from the offensive team's plays in an attempt to anticipate specific plays (thus, there are no specific defensive plays or formations).

In the original NES Tecmo Bowl, each team had 20 players on its roster, with nine players for offense, nine players for defense, a kicker, and a punter. In Tecmo Super Bowl, each roster had 30 different players. Each team had eleven defensive players, which could not be substituted, nor injured. Each team had seventeen offensive players, which included eleven starters and six substitutes. At any given time, eleven players were on the field for each team, consistent with NFL rules. A kicker and a punter were also on the roster.[2][3]

In addition to using real teams and players, TSB incorporated the full-length 1991 NFL regular season schedule for the game. The playoff format, including the Super Bowl and the post-season Pro Bowl game, was also used.

Tecmo Super Bowl retained the arcade-style football gameplay of the original which included the ability to break tackles (many players had "94" hitting power ratings, giving them the ability break any non-sliding tackles). However, the game added new features, such as statistics tracking that included All-Time NFL season records, expanded and editable playbooks[4], the ability to substitute players, varying conditions of players, fumbles, and player injuries. As it had previously, the game used cutscenes for important events like touchdowns and halftime shows. Tecmo Super Bowl also added cutscenes when injuries or big plays occurred.

Tips:

Sound Test
Press the L and R buttons at the same time at the title screen.

Easy Defense
When you're on defense, select the nose tackle (the middle man on the defensive line) and hold down-right.  When the ball is snapped, press B as soon as possible and you will shoot across the line and tackle the QB/RB (whomever has the ball). This doesn't work for every offensive play, but will work the vast majority of the time.

The game still had all of Tecmo's revolutionary features (breaking tackles), but now teamed with the NFL Players Association, the game had names for nearly all of its players, with a few players still under generic names (Like WR Niners). The game also added a new feature, Player Trades. Gamers were allowed to trade for four weeks before the season. For the first time, Jerry Rice could play for the Cowboys, or Deion Sanders could play for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The game was somewhat well known when it was released, but now, the game is relatively rare.

The full NFL license is used and the action is realistic for a side-view football game.

The game is closer to the real-life sport in comparison to its NES predecessors in several ways. Each team has a playbook of 8 passing plays and 8 running plays, any one of which can be switched out and another put in its place in the middle of a game. It also included some of the more nuanced strategies of football, such as attempting two-point conversions, and onside kicks. Also setting itself apart from the NES-era games was the in-game presentation, which is more akin to the realistic "TV style" presentation of modern football games like the Madden series. After a big offensive play, or a turnover or sack on defense, a box would appear on screen with a small grayscale picture of the player involved alongside his current statistics for the game.

The series' shift towards greater realism is also reflected in the game's season mode, which included a full 16-game NFL schedule and playoffs. Firstly, it records fairly detailed statistics of each game, and records and save cumulative statistics for each team in the league throughout the season. Also throughout the season the game would maintain a list of leaders across the league in each major statistical category, and would record when a player or team broke an NFL record. The rosters for each team can also be customized by the user, and the stating lineup of a user-controlled team can be changed at any point in Season mode. Tecmo Super Bowl III's season mode also features occasional injuries, which would last for varied amounts of time just as in real life.

Tips:

Heal an injured player
When you start a game while one of your players is injured, go to the setup screen and then go back to the main menu, do this over and over until you see that your player has returned

Hall of Fame players unlocked
Win 3 straight Super Bowls with the same team. When you enter the 4th season have trade mode on. Now you can
sign hall of fame players from the free agent pool.

Shredder Just Picked Up a Woman

Sunday evening. You're sittin' around the sewer watching your main reporter, April O'Neil, do a live remote from the Statue of Liberty. Then it happened. A humunguso flying android screamed out of the sky and ripped Lady Liberty from her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below.

"No way!" cried Raphael. "Way," replied Donatello. "And I'll bet you all the pepperoni in Little Italy who's flying that heinous scrap heap." Leonardo grabbed his Katana Blades. "Let's pop by our friendly neighborhood Technodrome and pay Shredder a visit."

With the cunning of an ancient ninja warrior, you battle through the first three levels that lead right to the heart of the Technodrome. There you find Shredder controlling the metallic terror by remote. "You've been a bad boy, you bloated bean bag," says Leo. "But it's nothing a good thrashing can't fix." After you defeat Shredder, he goes over the edge, knocking everyone into an activated Matrix Translocation Beam. With a flash you're all sent back in time. Now you have to fight Shredder and his horde of historic hooligans through six levels of utter weirdness. You've read history in class. Now it 's time to rewrite it.

--From the SNES Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 4: Turtles in Time instruction manual.

Overview:

The evil Shredder has stolen the Statue of Liberty! What is his evil plot this time?

Sending the Turtles back in time, of course! The Turtles will have to battle through the past and future to find their way home!

Turtles in Time made great improvements over the previous Turtles games, mainly because it was on the Super Nintendo this time. The graphics were updated, with more detailed sprites and backgrounds, making the gaming experience that much better. Very similar to the cartoon series, good animation as well. Also the various stages were each quite different, so you got a look at several backgrounds, not just the same thing with different colors and tile-sets.

Directions:

Use your turtle of choice to beat up the Foot and take down the Shredder.

Items:
Pizza - Heals you
Bomb - Activates ultimate spin attack(Move around to hit all enemies on screen)
?- Bonus points

You've got a couple of moves you have to string together to make it through this adventure. Your basic attack is going to be your most valuable asset. For a more powerful attack, press attack and jump at the same time.

JUMP ATTACKS:
Flying Kick- In the middle of your jump, press attack.
Weapon Slice- At the top of the jump, press attack.
Hop Kick- As soon as you leave the ground, press attack.
Drop Kick- Just before you hit the ground, press attack.

You can use the dash feature with jumps and attacks to trip up your foes(You can change dash to a manual double tap instead of auto from the option screen). Once you start dashing, press attack to do a body slam. The body slam can break enemy blocks. If you press jump while dashing you will do a flip. Press attack during the flip to do a sliding attack that will knock over enemies.

Throw: To throw an enemy, stand next to them and hold the attack button. 

Controls:

B Button - Jump
Y Button - Attack
Start Button - Pause

Tips:

One plays as the T-800 sent back in time to 1995 in order to protect John and Sarah Connor from the T-1000. There are two gameplay types: side-scrolling and driving. During the side-scrolling levels, the player's objective is to locate and retrieve all future objects (gray boxes with a flashing light on top) and complete all objectives for that mission. Once all objectives are completed, the player goes back to the beginning of the level to finish the mission. Between the side-scrolling levels are the driving levels. During the driving levels, the player's objective is to drive to the next mission location by following a compass directions, while avoiding pursuers.

In the side-scrolling levels, the T-800 has 100% health to begin with, but gets 50% health from the secondary power supply if its health drops to 0%. If the secondary power supply drops to 0%, the T-800 dies and the game ends. In the driving levels, the T-800 has 100% vehicular health, but the game ends if the health reaches 0%.

Starting with Level 3, the T-1000 will appear (or Level 2 if the alarm is tripped or too much time is spent there). The T-1000 attacks using a pistol and arms morphed into stabbing weapons. The T-1000 will mold back into shape if shot, but it will be temporarily incapacitated if it suffers enough damage. The T-1000 does not appear in levels 6 and 7.

The T-800 must also protect John Connor starting with Level 3, and Sarah Connor starting with Level 4. If either one loses all of their health, they will start dying, and the T-800 must heal them by ducking down over them and transferring some of its health to them. If they are left alone for too long, they die and the game ends. However, Sarah Connor wields a pistol for extra defense. Neither one appears in levels 5 or 6.

Terranigma
Platform: Super NES
Region: Europe
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1996
Developer: Quintet
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: 1
_________________________
*
Terranigma keeps a constant top-down perspective view of the world and utilizes an action-based battle system that allows the player to perform different techniques depending on whether the protagonist is running, jumping, attacking, or using a combination of these three actions. Each attack is meant for dealing more damage to certain kinds of enemies, though in most cases there is little or no difference regardless of the technique used. Projectiles launched at Ark can be blocked by the guard technique otherwise ineffective against melee attacks.

With each victory, experience points are gained, increasing the protagonist's level and his maximal hit points, strength, defense and luck. Slain enemies sometimes leave behind gems which can be used to buy weapons, armors, healing items and spells.

There are no magic points in the game, all spells take the form of one-time-use items instead. The player must collect Magirocks and take them to a magic shop to have them transformed into magic rings and summon medals. Those items are used up when casting the corresponding spell and then turn back to Magirocks which may be exchanged for new spells again. Upon defeating bosses and completing miscellaneous tasks, new types of magic become available.

Setting:

In Terranigma, the Earth is portrayed as a hollow sphere that has both an external and internal face. Since the beginning of the Earth, the external Lightside, the surface world, stood for growth whereas the internal Darkside, the under world, represented decline. Over the course of billions of years, these two forces came to be called God and Devil. Regardless of the inner antagonism, rapid progress took root and primitive life forms evolved to plants, animals and humans. Technology and industry revolutionized the evolution, but the fight between God and the Devil was still taking place, more fiercely than ever. The conflict culminated in a final battle at the southernmost point of the surface world. However, neither of the two forces was victorious. The continents of the surface world submerged into the sea and the under world was sealed away.

Tips:

Almost Free Saving and Inn in Litz
It normally costs you 10 Gems to get to the Diary in Litz, which is in the inn room with your bed. However, if you pay the man guarding the door for your room but never actually use the bed (use the food on the table outside instead) you can heal and save for free!  (Note: you will have to use the bed to trigger a cut scene after beating Bloody Mary)

Easy 500 gems
In Louran, go to Temjin's house and talk to him. When he asks you what to do with his money, tell him to take it to his grave. Later on, when Louran transforms into a ghost town, go to the cemetery and check the most northwest grave. It's Temjin's. Guess what, the guy took your advice and you've just become 500 gems heavier.

Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.

In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or "line" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).

In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).

For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.

Tetris 2 is back!

Tetris 2, the popular sequel to the megahit Tetris, is back and more fun than ever on Super NES!

Tetris 2 consists of red, blue, and yellow blocks. In addition to having different colored blocks, the game also features three block types: Falling Blocks, Flash Blocks and Fixed Blocks. The object of Tetris 2 is to arrange the Falling Blocks so three or more blocks of the same color line up horizontally or vertically. When a horizontal or vertical match occurs, the similarly colored blocks disappear. To win, you must strategically place your Falling Blocks and eliminate all Fixed Blocks from the screen.

While maintaining the sophisticated simplicity of the original Tetris game, Tetris 2 moves forward with exciting puzzles that are more captivating than ever!
--from the SNES Tetris 2 instruction manual

Tetris 2 is a pretty cool puzzle game. Unlike trying to make lines all the way across the board, in Tetris 2 you try to line up blocks of the same color. You only have to get three of the same color for them to disappear. Tetris 2 also adds some new, weird looking blocks. Some of them will even be designed to drop off a certain piece of the block, while you place the other piece somewhere else. There is also a puzzle mode on Tetris 2. They start you off with just one or two blocks, and you have to use it/them to eliminate the whole board. The puzzle mode is my favorite. Tetris 2 was a great addition to the super smash hit Tetris. If you like puzzle games, you'll love this!

Directions:

Line up at least three blocks of the same color to make them disappear, so you can get to the flashing blocks and make them disappear, thus clearing the board.

Tetris Attack is a puzzle game in which you rearrange the order of a stack of panels in order to clear them. As the stack begins rising, switch two horizontally adjacent panels. If you place at least three identical panels in a row vertically or horizontally, they will disappear. If the stack of panels touches the top, the game is over.

--From the SNES Tetris Attack instruction manual.

Overview:

Tetris Attack is a very fun and addictive addition to the Tetris series. I used to play this game for hours and hours. I love the use of colors and the graphics on this game. The music was very catchy also. Tetris Attack was just a pleasure all around. The controls were simple and responsive. The replay ability of this game is very high, as with almost any puzzle game. I recommend you give this game a try; be careful though, you may get hooked.

Directions:

You can play against the computer or your friend in several different ways. The game plays like this. Make three or more blocks that match touch, and they will dissappear, allowing you to score. Do this by moving your cursor to two blocks you want to switch and press B. Whenever you score, the blocks will stop moving up for a second. When you connect more than three blocks together it is called a combo. The way to get really big combos is to try to match up four or five of two different colors at the same time. The more you connect together the higher your point score will be. The pile will also stop for longer periods of time when you this.

Blocks left hanging will fall, and if they fall beside two or more blocks that match, you will start a chain. These can go on for a while if you try to make changes to the bottom while the chain is happening so you can keep it going. Chains will also stop the pile longer than normal scores. On top of the point score bonus, whenever you make combos, or chains, your opponent will get garbage dropped on his screen. He will, however, be dropping it on you at the same time if he is any good. To get rid of garbage simply score with at least one block that is touching it, and the piece of garbage will turn into blocks. If you pay attention, when the blocks are falling you can make changes to the bottom for chain points that will land more garbage on your opponent.

In endless mode you play until your stack has reached the top. Time trial requires you to reach a certain point score before time runs out. Stage clear is a mode in which it gives you a certain amount of blocks to clear before you can move on. There are several stages to beat in this mode. In puzzle mode you must clear a puzzle in a certain number of moves in order to move on to the next. 

Controls:

A Button - Switch highlighted panels/ Confirm menu selection
B Button - Switch highlighted panels/ Cancel item
X Button - Cancel your last switch
Y Button - Cancel your last switch
X and Y Buttons - Restart the current puzzle (Puzzle Mode Only)
L Button - Raise the stack of panels
R Button - Raise the stack of panels
Start Button - Start/Pause
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Bonus Characters
At the player vs. player character select screen, hold L+R on both controllers for about five seconds. The question marks at the bottom will be replaced with pictures of the bosses.

Start vs. mode with 90 continues
Enter these at the 1P vs. password screen. When it says ERROR! keep pressing the B button to backup to the menu
that says new game and password and select new game. Choose a difficulty level and start the game.  Now when you loose it will say you have 43 or 90 continues.

DCYYYQRL start with 43 continues
SSSSSSSS start with 90 continues

Secret Character
Go to the Player vs. Player character select screen, then hold L + R on both controllers for a few seconds.  If you did it right, the question marks (?) at the bottom of the screen will be replaced by bosses.

Guaranteed Victory vs. CPU
If you have a controller with a 'turbo' option for buttons A or B, you can use the following exploit against the CPU so that you always win!

First, when you turn on the game and Yoshi appears in front of a blue screen and says 'Nintendo, ' press B, A, L, L. You should hear a confirmation code when you input the cheat correctly. This will remove the 'freeze' that occurs when you or your opponent makes a combo or a chain. In other words, the blocks never stop rising. After entering the cheat, activate turbo for either A or B. Once you are competing against your CPU opponent in split screen, place your cursor over any two blocks or one block and an empty panel, and hold down turbo. The panels will switch back and forth so quickly that your blocks will not rise, nor will garbage blocks fall on you! Eventually, the speed of the rising blocks will surpass the CPU's ability to get rid of them and you will win!

Although it takes a while in later stages, you can use this exploit to beat every difficulty in VS. Mode.

How to control the cursor in How to Improve Mode In any of the sessions hold down the button.

Time Trial x? chain bug
In Time Trial, you get progressively more and more points for larger chains until the 13x chain. However, if you keep a chain going any longer than the 13th link (x?), you don't get any chain-link bonus points.  For this reason, you should never let a chain go past the 13th link in time trial.

All Endings
Good Ending: Beat the game using no continues.  Bad Ending: Beat the game with at least one continue.

Move Yoshi on Credits Screen
After you've beaten the game on Medium difficulty or higher and the credits are rolling, hold SELECT and you can use the Control Pad to move Yoshi around in the background.

The 7th Saga
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Produce
Publisher: Enix
Players: 1
_________________________
*
The player chooses one of seven playable characters, all of whom separately embark on a quest to locate seven magical runes. As the player progresses through the game from one town to the next, they will encounter the other six characters on multiple occasions. The player may partner with one of the other playable characters to fight as a team, and they may also fight against other playable characters for the runes.

Notable unique innovations include the use of a crystal ball "radar" that allows players to see enemies approaching their character in dungeons and in the overworld. This means that combat is not totally random, as players may theoretically avoid enemies (although enemies move extremely quickly and randomly, making combat difficult to avoid). The game also uses Mode 7 graphic effects to create the transition between exploration screen and battle screen.

The game is particularly known for its unforgiving difficulty, considering that you might spend a great deal of time leveling up to advance in the game.

Story:

The game takes place on a world called Ticondera. 5000 years ago, a divine being named Saro defeated an evil entity named Gorsia with the power of seven runes. In the years since then, the runes have been scattered across the globe. Lemele, the son of Saro, was born 100 years ago, and became a hero when he defeated the demon Gariso. Now 100 years old, Lemele has become the benevolent and powerful ruler of the world.

The seven characters are recruited from various walks of life and corners of the globe by the elderly King Lemele. After 5 years of training at his palace, Lemele dispatches his seven apprentices in a quest for the seven runes. Each rune possesses a great power that can be used by the person who wields it. The one who collects all seven runes will become Lemele's heir. To find the runes, the king gives each character a Crystal Ball to assist them in their search.

Retrieving the runes means confronting the various powerful tyrants who have come into their possession, including wizards, kings, and dragons. The apprentices are also being hunted by a persistent bounty hunter named Pison, who has been hired by one of the apprentices to eliminate the rest (the identity of the "traitor" apprentice is randomized with each new game).

After defeating a resurrected Gariso and collecting all seven runes, the player is confronted by Lemele, who reveals that he is actually Gorsia. Gorsia traveled to the present from 5000 years in the past, killed Lemele and took his identity, then recruited the seven apprentices to locate the runes for him. The power each rune contains is actually a trapped portion of Gorsia's power. Gorsia destroys the runes, re-absorbs his lost power, and zaps the player with lightning, sending them to a strange, unfamiliar world which turns out to be Ticondera 5000 years in the past.

After passing through several towns, the player eventually ends up in the technologically advanced city of Melenam, which was originally explored as ruins by the player early in the game. Melenam is revealed to be the orign of the Tetsujin robots, and the player witnesses the destruction of the city at the hands of a rogue super-Tetsujin created by the city's scientists for the purposes of fighting Gorsia.

The player eventually learns that although Saro had recently defeated Gorsia, Gorsia has returned from the future and fatally wounded Saro. Saro's disciples give the player the seven runes, which the player uses to seal Gorsia's powers and eventually defeat the evil being.

The dying Gorsia kills the player in one last act of revenge, but 4900 years later Saro reincarnates the player's soul as a young baby and Saro's son: none other than Lemele.

Morticia Has Been Kidnapped!

Uncle Fester has lost his memory and has fallen under the spell of Abigail Graven, a conniving character who is anxious to lay her greedy hands on the Addams' hidden fortune. Having recruited a misled Uncle Fester, and assisted by her cohorts, Tully and The Judge, she manages to capture and imprison the other members of the Addams Family within the huge Addams Mansion!

Only Gomez can save the day by freeing his son Pugsley, his daughter Wednesday, and Granny; and by restoring Uncle Fester's memory.

As if things weren't ooky enough! Wednesday has been a perfectly taunting child. She's gone and devised a simply torturous game which will drive her darling wretched brother, Pugsley, to happiness. How absolutely delicious!

Wednesday has hidden six wonderfully strange items somewhere about the Addams Family mansion. Now, you must guide poor Pugsley on his quest to uncover them.

Traps, traps, trap you say! Well, yes. What else would add so much lovely horror to this unnaturally delightful fun? Little Wednesday, so full of charming woe, has made sure this adventure will be a doom-filled doozy. There are even hidden switches all about, which produce the loveliest blood-curdling effects when Pugsley runs into them.

Let's not forget all the money that Pugsley will be able to gather on his way. There's even magic money which will have an extra lively effect you won't want to miss. So get ready to get spooky, and get set to get kooky... It's Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt! En garde!

--From the SNES Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt instruction manual.

The plot of Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt centered around Pugsley's attempts to win a scavenger hunt challenge proposed by his sister, Wednesday. His hunt takes him to the bedrooms of each member of the Addams family in order to find one item from each.

A major source of criticism for the SNES version was the lack of a password feature, despite the game being very difficult. A password feature is present on both the NES and Game Boy versions.

The Adventures of Batman & Robin

Genre: Beat 'em Up
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Konami
Publisher: Konami
Players: 1 or 2 CO-OP

It seems that the dynamic duo have some work ahead of them. When the world's worst Super-Villains are running loose in Gotham, it's up to the Dark Knight and the Boy Wonder to stop them. Batman and Robin have to run into the fray to put a stop to their evil plans. So start playing and save the day, on the same Bat-site, same Bat-console.

Adventures of Batman and Robin is a delightful game with wonderful graphics and awesome sound. The graphics have an animated theme that stays true to the cartoon that the game is based off of, right down to the look of the city in the background. The music is right on with the theme and holds true to TV series as well. All in all this is a fun and entertaining game, and any fan of the Batman series or the beat-em-up genre should give it a try. So good luck, and enjoy!

Directions:

The Adventures of Batman and Robin is a fun side-scrolling platform game that takes you through various locations in Gotham City, in your quest to nab the world's worst villains. Play in one player mode as Batman, or two can play together as both Batman and Robin, working together to make Gotham safe.

Run through each level beating up lackeys to get to the super villains such as Catwoman, Two-Face, the Penguin, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and the Joker. At least the bosses are not giant monsters or robots or anything, although as super-villains they do have super-powers. They each have a pattern of attack, which should be learned in order to defeat them quickly.

Throughout each level you will find little hearts that replenish your health, which is in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Also, before each level you are given the chance to fill your utility belt with different gadgets to help you along the way. Items include Bat-grapple, Bat-erang, smoke bombs, flash light, and infra-red goggles.

Win the game by locking up all the bad guys (and bad girls) and making the streets of Gotham safe once again. Good luck, Dynamic Duo!

When we last saw our heroes, they were relaxing in the shadow of their new "soon to be opened" museum. But when disaster strikes Frostbite Falls, Rocky and Bullwinkle must jump into action to once again stop the evil Boris and Natasha from delivering stolen artifacts from the Rocky and Bullwinkle Museum to their Fearless Leader. Join Moose and Squirrel on their adventure to foil yet another attempt by Boris and Natasha to accomplish something utterly pointless.

On the other hand, you could also take control of Mr. Peabody and Sherman on their adventures through time to teach Sherman valuable lessons. Then again (on a completely different hand) you can play Dudley Do-Right and save the beautiful (but pixelated) Nell from the dastardly Snidley Whiplash.

Directions:

Play Rocky and Bullwinkle as they climb mountains, swim streams, and explore caves in the pursuit of Boris and Natasha to get back their priceless trinkets. Avoid bouncing rocks, strange mechanical mice, and other such creatures on you adventure. This game also gives you the option to play side adventures such as Mr. Peebody and Sherman as they fight a dragon with bubblegum, or play Dudley Do-Right as he rides his horse Horse to try and outrun Snidley Whiplash's train to save the beautiful Nell Fenwick. After beating each side adventure, the game automatically transfers over to the main game. This is a fun side-scrolling action/adventure that is sure to give you hours of enjoyment, if not frustration, at the many challenges.

"Could have been a great deal better if it had anything to do with the movie..."

I'm sure many of you reading this are familiar with the 1980 John Landis film following the adventures of Jake (John Belushi) and his brother Elwood (Dan Ackroyd) as they venture on a spiritual journey across the US to bring their blues band back together for a gig to save an orphanage from shutting down.

If you picked up this game expecting find any of the great action and car chase sequences from the film, you're going to be very disappointed. Instead, Titus have cooked up a cookie cutter Mario platform clone that has nothing to do with the film except borrowing the lead characters. It's really nothing new if you have played the NES version which is just as awful and unrelated to the movie as this game.

Story - 2/10
At first looking at the game you may wonder, when the HELL did any of this happen in the movie? Well to put it simply, Jake and Elwood have had too much booze and not enough snooze, causing them to drift off to a hellish nightmare created inside the world of a jukebox, where they venture across bizarre worlds and fight strange cartoony creatures. It's a dream - a cop out excuse to make a platform game.

Graphics/Presentation - 6/10
I'll admit that I did find The Blues Brothers to be a vibrant and colorful game, upon starting the system you see a very bright pink title screen adorned with colorful musical notes. There isn't much of an introduction apart from seeing our hapless boys standing cheerfully in front of a jukebox before being zapped in. Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock and roll!

For the in game graphics - they're bright and colourful, reminding me of Super Mario World and a few other cute mascot platformers. Jake and Elwood are thankfully different characters rather than the usual palette swaps of the same character. The game scrolls smoothly as you travel across the pink sunset of the first area. It's typical 16-bit platformer fanfare, with nothing to really make you say WOW (not even a hint of scaling and rotation besides the character select screen). There is a great deal of recycled scenery - laziness on the artists part? or maybe the game was only programmed on an 8 meg cart.

Gameplay - 3/10
Here's where the game really takes a dive. It's side scrolling platform action similar to the Mario games, minus the fun. Take your pick of Jake or Elwood (or both in co-operative 2 player) and get ready from some tedious platforming action. Make your way across the strange landscape while firing records at the various enemies that come your way.

Apart from collecting records, cream pies can be attained that causes your player to turn buff ala Altered Beast, and you can jump higher and do more damage with your attacks. Get hit once and you lose the ability. Also along the way are mini Jukeboxes that give you temporary invincibility.

While this may sound like fun, the gameplay is not as enjoyable as it sounds. The enemies have a habit of homing in and pestering you, and they respawn again if you happen to return to that part of the screen again. They come in the form of animated insects, lawn mowers, bear traps, bulldogs, and other odd animals. There is some sort of flying caterpillar you can ride in the few bonus stages that pop up, and it can be a hassle to control it.

The platforming aspects are tougher than the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros 2 and you'll be cursing at the cheap deaths that will sneak up on you. The camera is also erratic, and can be a nuisance when you need to jump large spaces from mushroom to mushroom. I never did get around to finishing this game, as there are just too many stages to play in one sitting, and the scenery is repeated after the first few stages. Add in the tedious stage layout and annoying enemies and you have a game that isn't worth the effort of playing seriously.

Multiplayer - 5/10
If you do decide to play this game, you'll probably have more fun with another player. Venting your anger by firing your records at them and picking them up is fun, and you'll need to be in time with your friend to make the platform jumps as the game won't scroll without the other player following.

Control - 6/10
While the button layout is good, the character movement is a bit dodgy, and it can seem like you're travelling on ice sometimes as the players have a high skid factor after making them run.

Soundtrack/Audio - 7/10
Probably the game's only redeeming feature is the soundtrack. The sound effects are your standard cartoony samples, and a few voice clips from the movie made it in. The music is very good, apparently composed by some famous French dude.

It's a selection of jazzy blues tunes with some tracks recreated from the movie. Sounds great for SNES music, although 7 tunes is far from adequate for a game that's main theme is music.

Replayability - 3/10
There's no reason to torture yourself by coming back to this game, after playing it for half an our you probably won't want to return, except maybe to mess around in the 2 player mode or listen to the music.

Overall - 4/10
Stay away from this pitiful platformer unless you're curious about the music or funny co-op. It's well drawn and the music is great, but it lacks any real gameplay value to justify a purchase. Then again, it probably costs around $5 or less on eBay, so you could always buy it just to add another title to your SNES collection. If you found this game awful, don't even thing of playing Blues Brothers 2000 on the N64, its practically the same as this game but in 3D.

The Chessmaster
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA

Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Board Game , Chess
Release Year: 1991
Developer: Mindscape
Publisher: Mindscape
_________________________
*
Way back when, in a time when TV's and videogames didn't exist, people found other ways to entertain themselves. They would usually resort to board games or knight events. There was one man though, who had a love for the board game, Chess. He was unbeaten in all the land and therefore, became known as the Chess Master.

Chess Master is a very simple game in theory, but challenging in skill level. You have to have a lot of patience to play. One of the odd things about this game is that it doesn't have a difficulty setting. This is kind of good and kind of bad. If you can already beat it, you can't make the game harder, but at the same time, if it's too hard, you can't make it easier, so it kind of forces you to step your game up, in a good way though. The graphics are OK. A little pixelated maybe, but OK. It has a little bit of MIDI music at the start up screen and little dings and dongs during the game. It doesn't take much set-up or anything. You just load it up and play chess.

Directions:

Once you load the game up, the title screen will appear. After the Title screen appears, you hit the Start Button and begin playing. Once in the game, you can hit the select button to open a menu with lots of options.

Under "Actions", you can begin a new game, change sides (colors), choose to play against the Chessmaster or against another person, force the Chessmaster to move, get advice from the Chessmaster, take back a move, replay the previous game, set up the board, and solve for mate. Under "Settings", you can change the level of play, whether or not Deep Thinking, Opening Book, and Teaching Mode are on or off, whether or not the Board Coordinates are on or off, board view, where the white pieces are, whether or not the background music is on or off, and Mate In 1-5 Move(s).

All pieces move according to standard rules. Pawns can move two spaces forward on their first move, and then one space forward on the rest of their moves, but they can only attack diagonally. Also, they can't move backwards like the rest of the pieces. If you can reach the other side of the board with a pawn, you get to turn it into any piece you want. Rooks, or castles, can only move up-down and left-right, but unlimited spaces. Knights, or horses, move in an L-shape, two spaces up, left, down, or right, and then one space perpendicular to the first move. The Bishops can only move diagonally, but unlimited spaces. The Queen can move any direction, and unlimited spaces. The King can move any direction, but only one space. Once the King is taken, the game is over. White always moves first. When you win or lose, you just start over again.

Genre: Board Game , Chess
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Technos Japan
Publisher: American Technos
_________________________
*
The SNES version of The Combatribes makes a few changes to the game. The game now has an opening intro which details the plot of the game, as well as dialogue and cut scenes between the main characters and the game's bosses. The gameplay remains the same, with the character's health now represented by a life bar instead of numeric values. There are no weapons to be picked-up and thrown in the SNES version, the stages are simpler and some of the enemy characters are missing. The fifth stage is composed of a boss rush against all the previous gangs before facing the Slaughter Troops. The sixth and final stage is simply a final battle against Martha Splatterhead set atop the rooftop of a high-rise building. She is noted to have unified and taken control of the gangs, rather than the unnamed crime boss in the arcade version who does not appear in this version at all. Additionally, only one Martha will fight the player, regardless of the number of players present at the final stage.

In addition to the main game, there's a one-on-one versus mode similar to the one featured in the NES version of Double Dragon. The player can perform Street Fighter II-style special techniques including fireballs and block attacks with some characters. The game's enemies can also be used by inputting passwords given in the main game.

The North American version of the game was censored, with the blood on enemy's faces during cut scenes being recolored to look like saliva, sweat and tears. One of the bosses, a cyborg general named Swastika, was renamed "Major Blaster", to remove obvious references to Nazism.

Platform: Super NES

Controller: Gamepad
Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Blizzard Entertainment
Publisher: Sunsoft
_________________________

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's SUPERMAN!! When Doomsday attacks Metropolis, it's up to Superman to stop him. Unfortunately, Superman is defeated while destroying Doomsday, and a cadre of heroes fight to honor his legacy (or so it seems): Cyborg, Eradicator, Superboy, and The Man of Steel all fight to keep Metropolis safe, however it may seem that some of them are more then they appear. What will Metropolis do without their hero?

The Death and Return of Superman is a wonderful game that is full of fun gameplay and excellent graphics, with a changing background and intense detail. The music keeps with the mood of the game, being that it is basically a fight to the death. This game is fun and entertaining and definitely worth playing.

Directions:

The Death and Return of Superman is a fun side-scrolling beat-em-up that lets you play a multitude of characters with different abilities. Superman's specials are heat vision and power slam, Cyborg has an arm cannon and flash bomb, Eradicator has plasma blast and plasma hands, Superboy has telekinetic blast and telekinetic flash, and Steel has iron rivet and a power dive.

Play through 10 levels ranging from the Metropolis power plant to Engine City. Each level will lead you to a boss fight with one of the following opponents: Clawster, Doomsday (two fights), Man of Steel, Cyborg, and Cyborg Head. The bosses in this game are the same size as the other characters, and to defeat them just run up and beat the ever living snot out of them. A good trick is to get them on the edge of the screen and keep hitting them, they will not be able to hit you.

Be sure to keep an eye on the upper left hand side of the screen, your health and lives are displayed there. Under your health you will notice little red circles: the more of those you have, the more times you can do your special attacks. Also, along you way you will be able to pick up blue and red "S"es. The blues restore your health, and the reds give you more red circles for your special. Also, while fighting the minor enemies, you can pick up pieces of the background to throw at enemies.

All in all, this is a fun game that is worth playing. So sit down, log in, and have fun.

The Duel: Test Drive II
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Racing , Cars
_________________________
*
Like the original Test Drive, the focus of The Duel is driving exotic cars through dangerous highways, evading traffic, and trying to escape police pursuits. While the first game in the series had the player simply racing for time in a single scenario, Test Drive II improves upon its predecessor by introducing varied scenery, and giving the player the option of racing against the clock or competing against a computer-controlled opponent.

The player initially is given the opportunity to choose a car to drive and a level of difficulty, which in turn determines whether the car will use and automatic or manual transmission--the number of difficulty options varies between gaming platforms. Levels begin with the player's car (and the computer opponent, if selected) idling on a roadway. Primarily these are two to four lane public highways with many turns; each level is different, and they include obstacles such as bridges, cliffs, and tunnels in addition to the other cars already on the road. Each level also has one or more police cars along the course.

The goal of each level is to reach the gas station at the end of the course in the least amount of time. Stopping at the gas station is not mandatory, and one could drive past it if inattentive. The consequence of not stopping results in running out of gas, a thus losing a car (life). The player begins the game with 5 lives, one of which is lost each time that the player crashes into something. If the player completes a level without crashing or running out of gas, then he or she is awarded a bonus life. In addition to losing a life, crashing adds thirty seconds to the player's time. Cars could crash into other traffic or off-road obstacles such as trees; they could crash by falling off the cliff on one of the mountain levels, or they could sustain too much damage by staying off the roadway for too long on the flatland levels. Players could also lose a life when using a manual transmission by redlining and consequently blowing the engine. 

Crashing into a police car instantly ends the game, regardless of the number of lives the player has left.

Police cars appear in every level, and if the player is driving faster than the speed limit when encountering one of them, the police car will follow in pursuit. If at any point while being pursued the police car is able to pass the player's car get in front of it, the player is forced to pull over and receives a ticket stating the offense and the speed of the vehicle. While this doesn't cost the player a life, it does take away valuable time. Players can avoid being pursued by police by slowing down before encountering them, anticipating them through the aid of a radar detector, which comes standard in all vehicles in the game.

Tips:

Car Customization
Start a new game, pick your car, and start a race.  Before the cars start to move, hold the L and R buttons on Controller 2 to make the Customize Car Screen to appear. You can use Controller 2 to change your cars options. If you have enough speed, you can press the A button on Controller 2 to jump.

Turbo Boost
While racing on controller 1 hit A on controller 2 for a quick boost of speed

The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey & Minnie
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Players: 2-Player (alternating)
_________________________
*
Originally titled The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey and Minnie, this game was released for the Super NES, Sega Genesis and Game Boy Advance. It features both mice, who must discover why the circus suffered an attack from Baron Pete.

The game ditches the alternating two-player method in favor of simultaneous co-op. Another new feature is a password back-up.

Both Mickey and Minnie are identical gameplay-wise, and the costumes they receive don't differ from each other in any aspect except in the aesthetics.

The costumes include a sweeper, which can suck enemies and turn them into coins like the Poltergust 3000 from Luigi's Mansion, a safari suit that can climb walls and swing from hooks and a cowboy suit that shoots corks and maneuvers by bouncing. The the latter two outfits can be upgraded at a shop.

Tips:

Level Passwords:
Pluto, Donald, Mickey, Goofy 1-The Jungle
Goofy, Donald, Mickey, Minnie 2-The Haunted House
Donald, Goofy, Pluto, Mickey 3-Caves
Minnie, Mickey, Donald, Goofy 4-Frozen Plains
Mickey, Goofy, Donald, Minnie 5-Barons Castle

Hidden 2-Ups
When in Stage One, the Haunted Circus, you will start the game on the fairgrounds. Just ahead is a small pond
with an enemy fish swimming in it. At about halfway through the water, there is a wooden support beam in the background. Swim past this and you will receive a 2-Up.

In Stage Two, the Jungle, there is another opportunity for a hidden 2-Up. After beating the halfway boss (the
giant turtle), you'll go a couple more screens and come to a section where you'll use the Safari outfit to slide down a number of vines. After reaching the bottom vine, swim in the water beneath, all the way to the left. The word '2-Up' will appear when you have found it.

A Friend In Need...

It seems that Waldo's good friend, the wizard Whitebeard, has lost five magic scrolls in the Realm of Enchantment. He asks Waldo if he can locate the scrolls for him before it's too late!

Well, our globetrotting hero can't resist a challenge, so he takes his trusty canine companion Woof along on their new adventure! Now it's up to YOU to spot Waldo and the missing scrolls as well as bonus points and much more! So keep a sharp lookout for fun in this colorful fantasy for the whole family!

--From the SNES Great Waldo Search instruction manual.

Overview:

The great searching game to find that elusive Waldo has come to the video gaming world. Find all the items before time runs out and win the area. There are four different areas, each with varying difficulty. Play by yourself or play with a friend and see whose score is the higher. Also find Waldo's dog and go on a magic carpet ride. Happy Hunting!

The Great Waldo Search is an interesting game with good graphics but little animation. The music of the game is good and entertaining. All in all, this is an entertaining game that you should try.

Directions:

This game is nothing but simple game play. Scroll from left to right with a magnifying glass, as you click on the items that need to be found: Waldo (of course) and a scroll. You must find them before the time runs out.

Throughout the area, you will find other items such as score numbers (which increase your score... duh), clocks which extend your time, and Waldo's dog.

By clicking on Waldo's dog, you will enter a sub-game which features the dog on a flying carpet flying around and collecting bones which add to your score.

The two-player option runs like the single player mode, except that you take turns, and the winner is the one with the highest score. This is a fun game and it will have you playing for hours. Have fun! 

Controls:

A Button - SELECT ITEMS
B Button - SELECT ITEMS

Your job in this action puzzler is to help prehistoric man to evolve by helping them discover tools, the wheel, weapons, or even fire. Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.

Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.

The Ignition Factor
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Jaleco
Publisher: Jaleco
_________________________
*
The Ignition Factor is a 2D adventure where the player controls a firefighter (ostensibly "you") through emergency situations in differing locations. Each level consists of multiple rooms, areas, or building floors where players can possibly explore, extinguish fires, and rescue people. Most levels dictate a specific number of people that must be saved within a set time limit for the mission to be considered a success. Fire spreads throughout an area automatically, and the player can be injured when touching a patch of fire on screen. The player can also be harmed by falling through holes in the floor.

The player has various tools of firefighting at their disposal. Before a level begins, the player may choose the primary and secondary equipment they wish to begin the level with. Only one of each type of equipment can be equipped at once.[3] Primary equipment consists of an oxygen mask and tank and three types of fire extinguishers that correspond to the different types of fires that can be encountered in the game; regular, chemical, and electrical. These fires and their extinguishers are red-orange, green, and blue, respectively. As these are used, a counter goes from 99 to 0. The counter of the regular extinguisher rapidly increases back to 99 after a brief period of inactivity, while the oxygen tank and mask and the other extinguishers can only go back to 99 after being resupplied by allies in the level.

Secondary equipment consists of a trusty fireman's axe, a rope for crossing gaps, a metal pole to reveal holes by checking for weak places in the floor, plastic explosives to blow through debris and certain wall sections, and CO2 bombs to extinguish large areas of fire. Only five plastic explosives and CO2 bombs can be carried at one time and can be replenished by an ally on the map.

Controls:

The direction pad is used to direct the character on screen. Pressing the pad twice in one direction causes the character to sprint. It should be noted that though the character can walk diagonally, he can not run diagonally. The character can jump with the use of the B button and can kick in jammed doors with the X button. The Y and A buttons are used to initiate the actions of the primary equipment and the secondary equipment that are equipped respectively. The use of the Start button pauses the game and brings up the inventory screen while the select button pauses the game and brings up the map screen.

The character is only capable of carrying five items (including the required red extinguisher/oxygen tank and mask) before their weight begins to affect his actions. While carrying five or six items, he is incapable of running or kicking but he will still walk at his normal speed. If he carries seven or more items not only can he not run or kick, his walking speed is drastically reduced.

Failing a mission occurs when the player either dies or runs out of time. The player is then shown a screen that displays the number of chances left (the game's term for continues) and is given the choice to try again, quit, or enter a password. The game allows the player a total of three chances. If the player chooses the try again, one chance is consumed and the player is returned to the level select screen and allowed to select a different level or retry the same level. If all chances are used, the game is over.

Reception:

After its American debut in 1995, The Ignition Factor has received varying levels of critical response. For instance, Electronic Gaming Monthly rated the game a 8.25 out of a possible ten, while Allgame gives a rating of three stars out of five.

_________________________

In the game, the player takes control of Slick in a storyline loosely tied in with the animated movie. The crash dummy is sent on a quest to recover the Torso 9000 and defeat the Junkman. The game adopts a traditional side-scrolling playing style in which each level must be finished from left to right and Junkman's minions defeated along the way. Whenever Slick suffers damage he loses a limb, until he has none left and dies. The loss of limbs does not otherwise affect gameplay.

In total there are sixteen levels to complete divided into four areas, each of which must be completed under a specified amount of time. To defend himself, Slick comes equipped with spanners he can throw at his enemies, although their supply is limited. At the end of each area a boss character must be fought and, when successfully completed, a bonus stage can be entered. In the bonus stage the player drives a crash test vehicle and rakes up bonus points as the speed rises.

Dr. David Banner, physician, scientist, searching for a way to tap into the hidden strengths that all humans have. Then, an accidental overdose of gamma-radiation alters his body chemistry. Now when David Banner grows angry or outraged, a startling metamorphosis occurs. The Creature is driven by rage and pursued by an investigative reporter.

"Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry."

The creature is wanted for a murder he didn't commit. David Banner is believed to be dead and he must let the world think that he is dead until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.

--From the SNES Incredible Hulk instruction manual.

Overview:

Countries across the globe spending trillions per year on defense, and the best we can do is send a Green Moron with an IQ of 17 out to do battle. Well, better him than me. The Hulk is battling aliens from another planet dressed up in shiny metal trashcans. Although I guess we must support the Hulk's efforts, it is a lose-lose situation. I mean, would you rather have Martians pushing you around or a mutant psychopath?

The Incredible Hulk makes his patent-pending roar as space-rays scream into him and as he is bombarded by the thunder of shoulder-launched missiles. You even hear the earth shake as he jumps into the air and lands. Although I was disappointed that when he throws the phone booth there is no crunching sound.

Great graphics as the Hulk marches through a barrage of angry-aliens. Great colors and artwork. The shading on the Hulk emphasizes his bulky muscles, achieved at the gym and the Purdue Physics Laboratory. The screen fence, and its effects on objects behind it, shows the amount of detailing that has been incorporated into the game.

Things won't get any easier as you progress through the game, so learn the techniques needed to destroy the aliens early or there may not be a later.

Directions:

OK, not only are you spaced out of your mind by the drugs that you have taken, but also your body looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger on steroids. Not only that, but Martians are everywhere. What is a man to do? Kill.

Think long, think wrong. Just kill. Currently Martians are not protected by Hate Crimes Legislation, so kill as many as you can before Edward Kennedy protects them.

When close to an object or enemy, push C-Button to pick it up.

_________________________
*
The Irem Skins Game is an arcade-style golf game that lets up to four players participate in a (you guessed it) Skins Game, where each hole has a cash prize of at least $10,000. The player with the fewest strokes after completing the hole earns the money, referred to as a "skin." Should players tie, the money is carried over to the next hole until someone finally wins it. There are also two bonus rounds that will give each player a chance to win $20,000 if he or she is the closest to the pin, and the winner of the competition is the player with the most money at the end of 18 holes.

Besides the Skins Game, the title also includes Match Play and Tournament, which involves playing either 18 or 36 holes against computer opponents. Players can choose between four characters to play as (three males and one female), who all differ in the following abilities: drive, power, accuracy, hook, slice, and backspin. Unlike many other golf games for the Super Nintendo, the golfer is on the screen at all times during play. The swing meter is represented by a long vertical bar that has a horizontal line moving up and down. After selecting your club, altering stance and determining power, simply press the button when the line reaches the target area to complete the swing.

They fight! and fight! and fight, and fight, and fight!... Itchy & Scratchy, from The Simpsons, are a cat and mouse cartoon duo. Itchy the mouse and Scratchy the cat exist only to find new and creative ways to attack and kill one another. As the latest cartoon adventures appear on the television, the violence spreads to brand new places.

Itchy & Scratchy is a single player platform side-scroller. The player controls Itchy, the mouse, and must defeat Scratchy, the cat, with a variety of weapons. Itchy caries a default mallet, but can pick up additional weapons on particular levels. Each of the seven levels takes place in a different fictional location and is designed as a maze of doors and platforms. After defeating Scratchy, he usually will return with a special contraption to attack Itchy, and must therefore be defeated again.

George Jetson was about to run out to work when his pal Captain Zoom appears out of thin air. Zoom tells him that Zora, the leader of SPREE ("Space Pirates Revelling in Evil Enterprises"), is planning on looting this solar system of all its resource! Unfortunately, in his last encounter with Zora, Zoom has used up all his strength and now he is powerless so he asks George to take over. He gives George his Pneumo Osmatic Precipitator (or P.O.P.) and bids him good luck. Can George save his family and this galaxy?

Guide George through 9 stages of intergalactic action armed with only his wits and the P.O.P....which is like a super vacuum. The P.O.P. can be used as a traveling tool by sucking onto walls and ceilings, it will enable George to climb up and across platforms. As a weapon, the P.O.P. can be used to suck up blocks or enemies and spit out at other enemies. George can also use the P.O.P. to breathe under water! Talk about multi-functional!

George's conditions are indicated by the number of hearts he has at the top of the screen. By collecting more hearts, it will refill George's health. Food items will increase your score and by getting a high enough score in each stage, you may get to play a bonus game.

The Legend of Gildiss

For over a hundred years he had descended like a vulture on the land of Malus and left nothing behind but a scorched ruin where the creatures of darkness could reign. After much pleading by the farmers and townspeople, the armies of Malus were gathered and sent to do battle with the mighty red dragon known as Gildiss. Not a single man returned.

In desperation, the King sought guidance from his wizard, Guindon. Guindon told the king that he could cast a spell that would put Gildiss to sleep for one year, but if and when Gildiss awoke, he would be more powerful. Looking out over the suffering that had befallen his kingdom, the King decided his people could take no more. And so he commanded Guindon to put Gildiss to sleep.

Now the year has almost come to an end and darkness has once again befallen the kingdom of Malus. In the last year, the King has sent forth hundreds of knights to find and destroy Gildiss as he sleeps. None have been heard from again.

Now, as the creatures of darkness stand ready to plunge the land of Malus into the abyss, a new band of adventurers plans to set forth before Gildiss awakes.

--From the SNES King of Dragons instruction manual.

Overview:

A red dragon by the name of Gildiss, who is the King of Dragons, is brought back to life by a dark wizard, and the dragon wreaking havoc in the towns, and he always got what he wanted. So 5 warriors set off to stop the wizard and slay the dragon!

Directions:

There are five different characters to choose from: Fighter, Cleric, Wizard, Elf, and Dwarf. Each one was their own strengths and weaknesses. At the end of each level, you have to face a certain boss. If you beat a level, you can get weapon or armor upgrades. Slash at the orbs to unleash their power! The fruit increases health a little, the gold and jewels raise experience points, and Yashichis give you a continue. 

Controls:

A Button - Raise Shield
B Button - Jump
X Button - Extra Joy Attack
Y Button - Attack
Start Button - Pause/Unpause

Tips:

99 Continues
Begin a normal game and play until you're defeated and you have no credits left. Before the time runs out immediately press Start on Controller Two, then quickly press Start on Controller One. Then select your character with the B button and your continues (credits) will increase to 99.

Two-player mode with same character
As the Capcom logo fades quickly and immediately press Down, R, Up, L, Y, B, X, A before the logo fades

The Lawnmower Man
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Movie Adaption
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Storm Sales Curve
Publisher: THQ
_________________________
*
The Lawnmower Man is a video game based on the 1992 film of the same name. The film was loosely based on a Stephen King short story, and stars a pre-Bond-fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo.

Dr. Lawrence Angelo is a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries (VSI) in "Project 5", a secret research facility that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and virtual reality (VR) training. Dr. Angelo is reluctant to use the research for military purposes, and after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard, Dr. Angelo is given a forced vacation. 

While taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he discovers Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living by doing odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence the title of the movie). Angelo takes in Jobe, subjecting him to VR treatment. The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, but after an accident, Dr. Angelo stops the experiments. The Shop, a secret agency overseeing Project 5, reinserts the drugs responsible for Jobe's violent behavior into the program and speeds up the treatment. As Jobe develops telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he began the treatments, and plots to take over all of the computers in the world.

Gameplay:

The player takes control of either Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (the mother of Jobe's best friend) in a typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player collects weapon upgrades or data discs. Once the player has collected a number of data discs, the discs morph into a Virtual Suit that gives the player protection from one hit.

The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. The game includes true-3D level connectors that are based on the CG sequences of the movie. These involve avoiding obstacles and the occasional high-speed shooting in the VR world. There are four different levels (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), and each takes a slightly different approach. Virtual World is set in first person and the objective is to dodge obstacles such as trees and arches to get to the exit. Cyber War is similar to Virtual World, but with some shooting stops. Cyber Run is set in the third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube involves fast travel and plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel.

Tips:

Infinite Lives
Pause the game and press B, R, R, A, Select, Select, Y, A, B, Y, A, B, then unpause and repause and press R, A,

As with many action/platformer video games, the plot is minimal except for revealing future stages. In this game, the players control Goemon and Ebisumaru (called Kid Ying and Dr. Yang respectively in all non-Japanese releases). After noticing some odd occurrences in their hometown, Goemon and Ebisumaru decide to investigate. They soon discover that Princess Yuki has been kidnapped by the Otafu army. To save the princess, the protagonists must travel through different regions of Japan to find clues about the army and the location of the princess.

Although both characters have different weapons and learn different attacks, they are functionally identical. Their primary short-range weapons have three levels and are improved in range by acquiring grey cats left by defeated enemies. Both characters are also equipped with thrown weapons from the beginning (which decreases money as you use it) and can acquire bombs by purchasing them in stores or by winning them in mini-games.

Each character can learn four Judo abilities which are functionally identical between the two characters. Level 1 Judo provides an animal companion for the character which they ride and can use to ram into enemies. Level 2 Judo releases an attack that can damage all enemies on the screen. Level 3 Judo gives the characters the ability to fly temporarily. Level 4 Judo unleashes a powerful repetitive attack.

Most stages are separated into two sections. The first section is centered on town exploration where players gather information, buy items, learn special Judo attacks, play minigames, earn money, etc. One of the most notable mini-games available is a recreation of the first level in Gradius, but also includes games such as air hockey, trivia, dice games, and even a lottery.

The second section of each stage is a platformer section where the players fight through minor enemies until they reach the end and defeat a boss. In two-player mode, the characters can work together by having one ride the other piggy-back style. The character riding controls the attacks, while the character being ridden controls the movement and jumping. This can simplify areas with large or awkward jumps as it only requires one player to land successfully.

After each stage is completed, a small scene occurs furthering the mostly simple and light-hearted plot, and the next stage is revealed.

In America and Europe, this game was followed by Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon for Nintendo 64 in 1998, and Goemon's Great Adventure for Nintendo 64 in 1999, as all subsequent releases for the Super Nintendo were absent of western release. In the United Kingdom, two Game Boy versions of Mystical Ninja starring Goemon were released. One was a stand-alone game and the other was part of Konami GB Collection Vol. 3.

This installment in the Zelda series was my favorite. Nintendo took it back to the original overhead view and upped the graphics. The game played a lot like the first one except it was a lot longer and there were a whole bunch of little sub quests you could complete, but that weren't mandatory to beat the game. A Link to the Past really did clear the way for all other Zelda games. If haven't tried this one, get on it right now.

Directions:

Collect all three pendants and all seven crystals to save Hyrule and Princess Zelda from the evil Ganon. 

This was the first Zelda game to have mini games that you could win prizes for. Well, that's if you don't count the money making game from the first one. A lot of the later Zelda games included bow shooting galleries where you could win a bigger quiver or a lot of money. This was also the first time Link had the option to pull something or push, instead of being able to push only. This was also the first one where he could pick random objects up or cut them up in order to find hidden goodies. 

Controls:

A Button - Action
B Button - Swing Sword
X Button - View Map
Y Button - Use Item
Start Button - Start, Menu
Select Button - End/Save Game

Hints:

Blind Spot In Tile Trap Rooms
In rooms with the poltregeist tiles, stand at the edge of the room and face the center of the room. The tiles will bounce harmlessly off the shield. 

Tips:

Chris Houlihan room
Start at the Sanctuary and run south with the Pegasus Shoes until you are outside. Then, run south and stop before you hit the barrier. Proceed to run west until you are able to run south. When you run south, you should be in a wooded area with guards. Navigate this area and find the entrance to the castle grounds. While still running, go around the castle grounds to the hole where you fall into at the beginning of the game. If you did it right, you should be in a room with 45 blue rupees and a Saharasla sign that says: 'My name is Chris Houlihan' and 'Let's keep
this between you and me. ' Sometimes when you are fighting Gannon, you may fall into a hole and this may happen.
}Death Mountain Descent Death Mountain Descent will allow you to explore all of Dark World without obtaining the third pendant, the Master Sword, or defeating Agahnim.

First, you'll want to get the Moon Pearl out of the Tower of Hera. That's necessary unless you want to stay as a bunny the entire time. Once you've acquired it, exit the dungeon. Now hop in the teleporter just outside the Tower of Hera and go to Dark World. Hop down the cliff, and make your way to the right. Go to where the broken bridge used to be in Light World.

Now stand right under the top statue, as far against the wall and statue as you can get. Mirror to Light World. This is the tricky part, you must move ONE PIXEL to the right. No more, no less. If you don't do it correctly, you have to start all over. After you've moved, wait until you get teleported back to Dark World. You should be ONE PIXEL closer to the ledge now. Now DON'T MOVE! If you move, you will have to start over again. Mirror back to Light World.

Now walk to the right until you're stopped by the bridge post. Wait until you stop flashing, and hold down the B button until your sword charges up, while still facing right. SLOWLY move backwards into the sparkly teleporter. If you don't do this slow enough, the trick won't work. When you teleport, if you don't get teleported back to Light World, you did the trick correctly. Now press right to jump off the cliff into the black stuff. Make your way around the black stuff and to the bottom of the screen.

Go down one screen and you'll be on top of a cliff in Dark World. Hop off the cliff and you're now allowed to
explore Dark World! If everything is glitchy, enter a cave, then exit and things will be normal looking.

Hookshot invulnerability
Anytime you have the Hookshot equipped, if any enemy or projectile comes to attack you, use the Hookshot, and
while the Hookshot is extended, the attack will go right through you, and you will take no damage.

The Lost Woods with Dark World Enemies
In the Dark World, go and stand EXACTLY where the mushroom is in the Light world(Somewhere in the Skull Dungeon). When you use the Magic Mirror to go back to the Light World, not only will you get the Mushroom but
the trees will be glitched and you'll be able to fight some of the monsters that are only in the Dark World! When you leave the forest, everything will go back to normal.

Acquire Invisibility Cape Early
There is a way to get the Magic Cape right after you get the Hammer in the Palace of Darkness(Dark World's
1st dungeon). In the graveyard in the Light World you'll notice there are dark colored rocks with the number 8 on the them surrounding a tombstone, but if you go to the same place in the dark world you can cut down a flower and dash into a pile of rocks that usually reveals a red ruby(worth 20 rubies). In this place you need to use your Magic Mirror north of the rock pile. If you've done this right you can circumvent the dark colored rocks in the Light World.

Note: You need to use the Magic Transporter between the Kakariko Village and the Lost Woods to reach this
location.

Free Green Potion
Throw an empty bottle into the fountain at the Waterfall of Wishing. The faerie who appears will give you a free green potion.

The Classic Edition is a project by me, Con, which turns BS Zelda into a "real" Legend of Zelda. You will play with classic characters, Link and Zelda, have Triforce Symbols instead of crosses and... play without the BS-X Timer!

I called this project "The Legend of Zelda - Forth Quest", because it can be regarded after Third Quest as a fourth quest to LoZ, Nes without any canon problems.

The core of this project is a time patch by Dreamer_Nom which disables the timer, hides it and forwards the game triforce related. Unfortunately DN left this patch inperfect, before he disappeared: the blue candle was never shop equipment (this problem occured due to Roto's patch) and the whirlpool didn't vanish after Dungeon 4, what happened because of a wrong time setting.

I waited 2 years to find a qualified hacker to solve these problems, but since nobody was able or interested I took the project in my own hands and started from point zero getting through the djungle of ASM hacking... and with the help of Tre and others I am proud and lucky to tell you that my mission is accomplished.

I, BS The Legend of Zelda - Map 1 and Map 2 (BS Zelda no Densetsu: Map 1 and Map 2) 

BS The Legend of Zelda was a remake of the NES game The Legend of Zelda, released for the Satellaview attachment for the Super Famicom in Japan.

BS stands for Broadcast Satellaview (commonly referred to as the BS-X). Using this add-on gamers could download the game from the satellite and save it onto either the base unit's memory or onto a BS-X Special Broadcast Cassette (but only Triforce of the Gods could be played outside of broadcast time).

Gameplay:

The gameplay was identical to its predecessor, but the maximum Rupees was increased to allow you more than a thousand (rather than 255 as in The Legend of Zelda), the overworld was heavily altered, and dungeons were completely different. This game was broadcasted in two versions, Map 1 and Map 2. Map 1 is sometimes referred to as a "Third Quest", in reference to The Legend of Zelda's Second Quest, and Map 2 would therefore be a Fourth Quest. 

Presentation: 

The game was divided into four weekly episodes. These episodes were downloaded from Satellite and played live, just as a TV programme. Due to technical limitations, the download time was a whole seven minutes just for one episode. The Satellaview was also used to broadcast actual videogame themed shows (probably containing ads and such to promote Nintendo games).

Here you may read a translation (with pictures) of a video taken during the original broadcast of the first week of Map 1.

Character Selection:

The player could configure their name and gender in the Satellaview game-selection interface. This then carried across to the game (similarly to Miis in Wii games). The characters themselves are nameless in-game. In actuality, they're Satellaview's mascots, and "come from another world" in this game (or at least they do in BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban, where either of them is known as the Hero of Light).

Live Voice:

BS Zelda's implementation of Live Voice was significantly different to that in BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban. When the clock hit certain times the game would pause and display Japanese writing onscreen (that apparently reads "listen"), and the player would hear a narrator (apparently playing the part of the Old Man, and allegedly the same voice actor as Sahasrahla) give a hint or suggestion. Under emulation the pauses are about two to three minutes long, which seems rather long winded and could be a result of faulty emulation (but it's hard to tell really). After that time the text disappears and gameplay resumes as before. 

Emulation:

Due to the live nature of the game in its original incarnation, the game's ROM could not be played properly on emulators. Many hackers have since created patches that removed the game's download pauses and time limits, pieced together all four episodes and given the game a title screen and file selection screen (both of which are reminiscent of the title screen and file selection screen from the original Legend of Zelda), all of which has ultimately allowed BS Zelda to be played as a traditional, non-Satellaview game. Some patches can even replace the game's protagonist with Link himself, or allow the player to select Link or one of the game's original characters via the file selection screen.

I took the concept behind Ocarina of Time Master Quest and came up with this version of Link to the Past- Master Quest!

The dungeons are now harder. Bosses are also harder. As far as I'm concerned, only two holes lead you to debug rooms, but I'm not fixing those because you have to be brain dead stupid to fall in them.

The game is completely playable.

One last note: The last release promised that it could be mixed and matched with the "bonuses." I'm afraid I made an error. I've made versions of the Master Quest patch so you can now, indeed, play as OoT's Link. There's different versions of it, fixing only hair, hair and tunic, and complete- as well as the untouched version (meaning only Master Quest).

Well, have fun and I hope to enjoy this version of Link to the Past!

(What's fixed)

The compass in the Desert Palace is there now. Also, the missing keys in the Forest Dungeon and the Ice Palace are back in there. I played around with some minor things, mainly jokes? cluck?

Fixed the Ice Rod Cave and 2nd Light World Dungeon? At least, I'm sure about the Dungeon, not the Ice Rod Cave.

New graphic hacks (not really, but I think these WILL be mix-and-matchable)

NOTE: There is one problem with the first dungeon of the Dark World. When you exit the dungeon, all the locked doors you opened will lock themselves up again. I haven't been able to check out this bug myself, but it was reported. I might look into it some day? So for now? Try not to die at that dungeon! ;) ~Moulinoski

This improvement adds a virtual in-game clock displayed on the status bar, along with a day/night cycling system using this clock that tints the palettes (excluding the status bar) in the overworld areas according to the hours. Tint colors and timer speed are easily customisable, everything is explained in the readme and it is easily usable for custom hacks. ASM source is included in the archive. It can be applied to a normal Zelda 3 ROM so that you would play through the whole game with this effect (though it doesn't change any event of the story), it hasn't been tested everywhere but it should work fine.

I, BS The Legend of Zelda - Map 1 and Map 2 (BS Zelda no Densetsu: Map 1 and Map 2) 

BS The Legend of Zelda was a remake of the NES game The Legend of Zelda, released for the Satellaview attachment for the Super Famicom in Japan.

BS stands for Broadcast Satellaview (commonly referred to as the BS-X). Using this add-on gamers could download the game from the satellite and save it onto either the base unit's memory or onto a BS-X Special Broadcast Cassette (but only Triforce of the Gods could be played outside of broadcast time).

Gameplay:

The gameplay was identical to its predecessor, but the maximum Rupees was increased to allow you more than a thousand (rather than 255 as in The Legend of Zelda), the overworld was heavily altered, and dungeons were completely different. This game was broadcasted in two versions, Map 1 and Map 2. Map 1 is sometimes referred to as a "Third Quest", in reference to The Legend of Zelda's Second Quest, and Map 2 would therefore be a Fourth Quest. 

Presentation: 

The game was divided into four weekly episodes. These episodes were downloaded from Satellite and played live, just as a TV programme. Due to technical limitations, the download time was a whole seven minutes just for one episode. The Satellaview was also used to broadcast actual videogame themed shows (probably containing ads and such to promote Nintendo games).

Here you may read a translation (with pictures) of a video taken during the original broadcast of the first week of Map 1.

Character Selection:

The player could configure their name and gender in the Satellaview game-selection interface. This then carried across to the game (similarly to Miis in Wii games). The characters themselves are nameless in-game. In actuality, they're Satellaview's mascots, and "come from another world" in this game (or at least they do in BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban, where either of them is known as the Hero of Light).

Live Voice:

BS Zelda's implementation of Live Voice was significantly different to that in BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban. When the clock hit certain times the game would pause and display Japanese writing onscreen (that apparently reads "listen"), and the player would hear a narrator (apparently playing the part of the Old Man, and allegedly the same voice actor as Sahasrahla) give a hint or suggestion. Under emulation the pauses are about two to three minutes long, which seems rather long winded and could be a result of faulty emulation (but it's hard to tell really). After that time the text disappears and gameplay resumes as before. 

Emulation:

Due to the live nature of the game in its original incarnation, the game's ROM could not be played properly on emulators. Many hackers have since created patches that removed the game's download pauses and time limits, pieced together all four episodes and given the game a title screen and file selection screen (both of which are reminiscent of the title screen and file selection screen from the original Legend of Zelda), all of which has ultimately allowed BS Zelda to be played as a traditional, non-Satellaview game. Some patches can even replace the game's protagonist with Link himself, or allow the player to select Link or one of the game's original characters via the file selection screen.

The Classic Edition is a project by me, Con, which turns BS Zelda into a "real" Legend of Zelda. You will play with classic characters, Link and Zelda, have Triforce Symbols instead of crosses and... play without the BS-X Timer!

I called this project "The Legend of Zelda - Third Quest", because it can be regarded as a third quest to LoZ, Nes without any canon problems.

The core of this project is a time patch by Dreamer_Nom which disables the timer, hides it and forwards the game triforce related. Unfortunately DN left this patch inperfect, before he disappeared: the blue candle was never shop equipment (this problem occured due to Roto's patch) and the whirlpool didn't vanish after Dungeon 4, what happened because of a wrong time setting.

I waited 2 years to find a qualified hacker to solve these problems, but since nobody was able or interested I took the project in my own hands and started from point zero getting through the djungle of ASM hacking... and with the help of Tre and others I am proud and lucky to tell you that my mission is accomplished.

The Lost Vikings, Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout, go out hunting, doing their daily viking chores. However, an alien by the name of Tomator plans to abduct these viking warriors in hopes that they will become an attraction at the Arena of Death. They try to escape, but wind up in a warp they enter empty-mindedly, and they are thrown through time.

In The Lost Vikings game, you get the chance to help them get back to where (and when) they belong. The vikings must solve many puzzles if the are going to make it home and no longer be known as the lost vikings. This game is a fun and zany video game that will have you playing for hours, with its good graphics and backgrounds and its awesome if strange music.

Directions:

You start off with three Lost Vikings. Each viking has a different and unique ability. Erik the Swift who can run, jump, and break walls, Baleog the Fierce, who uses a bow and sword, and Olaf the Stout who uses a big powerful shield! Try to get all the Lost Vikings at the EXIT sign using those abilities! Read the signs with the "?" on them to get hints. Be careful though, because in this game one hit means death, and if you don't get all the Vikings to the exit sign, you will either have to try again or the game is over.

Controls:

A Button - Push buttons, flip switches, talk to people
B Button - Jump (Erik), Swing sword (Baleog), Hold shield up (Olaf)
X Button - Use selected item
Y Button - Ram while running (Erik), Shoot bow (Baleog), Hold shield up (Olaf)
Start Button - Begin choice at main menu
Select Button - Select item during game-play

What has gone before...

It's not every day that three Viking warriors find themselves imprisoned aboard an alien spaceship... and it's certainly not every day that three Viking warriors trounce their alien kidnapper and come swaggering home in triumph. It was some time before Olaf, Baleog, and Erik's egos deflated, but eventually life returned to normal in their small northern village.

Or nearly so - for after their wild extraterrestrial adventures, the three brothers found themselves discontented with their former calm Viking lives...

Dissatisfied with his job as senior polar bear wrangler, Baleog the Fierce auditioned for the Nordic Gladiators but stomped out in disgust when he was barred from bringing his own weaponry. It was then that Baleog realized his responsibility to pass on his skills to the next generation of Vikings. He formed Baleog's School of Plunder, with a popular curriculum focusing on Pillaging, Plundering, and Setting Things On Fire. He became famous throughout Scandinavia for a brilliant lecture course entitled Geat-Crushing In Three Easy Steps. ("Step One: Select a Geat. Step Two: Aim high. Step Three: Crush.") He then went on a tour promoting his book Stalking The Wild Geat and its wildly successful sequel Just What IS A Geat, Anyway?

Olaf the Stout decided to pursue his dream of becoming a sumo wrestler and set off in search of the Land of the Rising Sun. He made it as far as the Land of the Noonish Sun before he turned back - not because the journey was too tough but because he couldn't find lasagna anywhere beyond the Mediterranean. Instead, he returned sheepishly home to his family and devoted himself to instructing his children in the arts of swordsmanship, looting, thundering, and making decent goat cheese. Both of his daughters now attend the Baleog School of Plunder- Olaf is especially proud of his eldest, Gerda, who has achieved the rank of Honorary Valkyrie AND can out eat her dad any day of the week. Olaf has appeared on "Lifestyles Of The Large & Bearded" and is busy working on a Combat Frisbee, although the neighbors insist that the idea will never fly.

Erik the Swift's experiences in outer space left him bored with village life. He ended up with the mystic Order of the Leaping Mountain Goat, where he finally learned peace, enlightenment, and how to eat a tin can whole. In fact, Erik emptied his mind so thoroughly that he then spent months wandering around dazed and confused, sculpting fjords out of mashed potatoes and believing he was an iguana. He regained his memory after several knocks on the head, all self-inflicted whilst attempting to ram open a can of tuna: --KANG! KANG!-- "Wait a minute! I'm not an iguana at all!" --KANG! KANG!- "Heeey, I'm Erik the Swift!" He swiped a ship and hurried home to the village, where he was warmly greeted by his brothers... especially Olaf, who was thrilled to discover that his own journey had NOT been the most ridiculous one in the history of the village, after all.

Early one fine Thor's-Day morning the three brothers set out together in their ship, the Ragnarok. Baleog wanted to do a little light plundering, Olaf felt like fishing. The argument was settled peacefully when Erik wisely sided with Olaf... that is, after Olaf threatened to pick him up by the braids and throw him overboard. After some good-natured brawling on the foredeck, the trio settled down to enjoy the cold, clear morning, and to wait for the sun to rise so that they could bait the fishing lines without sticking hooks through their fingers in the darkness.

Little do our heroes know that a specter from their past is stalking them high above. No, it isn't the Master of the Order of the Leaping Mountain Goat... it's Tomator, their alien captor of years before! Though their last encounter was only a year ago for Olaf, Baleog, and Erik, to the time-travelling Tomator his stinging defeat at the brothers' hands occurred only last week... and he wants revenge.

Fortunately, for an alien evil genius, Tomator is pretty sloppy. Once again, his ship malfunctions just as the three Norsemen are in his grasp... and this time, the Viking brothers are ready. They've grabbed some of Tomator's high-tech equipment and they know exactly what they have to do to get back to their homes and families: find Tomator and beat the snot out of him!

Will the Vikings find their way home across time and space? Will Erik lead his brothers to safety without bonking himself back into thinking he's an iguana? Will Olaf be reunited with his wife and daughters? Will Baleog ever to get a date with Freya, that Valkyrie babe on the "Resume Game" screen? Stay tuned...

--From the SNES Lost Vikings 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

The Lost Vikings 2 is a great addition to the series. The vikings come back with more cool stuff than ever. Not to mention the addition of two new characters. The game-play and graphics are almost the same as the original Lost Vikings game. The basic premise of the game is to use the special abilities of each of the vikings in order to help everyone through the maze which is each level.

I loved this game, it was very fun to play alone or with a friend. So I say give Lost Vikings 2 a chance, you won't regret it.

Directions:

In The Lost Vikings 2 use all of their abilities to solve the puzzles, and help them find their way home.

Extra Powers
To get extra powers for the characters in 'The Lost Vikings 2', kill Erik in the first stage. To do this, put Olaf on the highest ground in the stage, and have Erik stand on his shield. If jumps as high as he can, activates his rocket boots at the very height of the jump, and lands at the lowest point in the stage, he'll get hurt. Do this three times to kill him.  A message will appear, and that means that the powers have been activated. Here are the ones I've
found:

Erik: hold 'down' and hit 'Y' to shoot a huge spark (imagine a fireball from 'Street Fighter II'). It damages whatever is in its path.

Baleog: hold 'up' and hit 'B' to jump forward.  Baleog will damage anything that he touches while he's jumping. Also, hold 'down' and hit 'B' to slide forward, backward, and forward across the ground while slashing the energy sabre. Again, Baleog will damage anything that he touches while he's sliding.

Olaf: Press X + Y+B on the controller to turn into a skull and kill the nearest enemy.

Fang: repeatedly tap 'Y' to electrify Fang (don't worry; he'll look like he's taking damage, but he isn't). As long as you do this, anything that touches Fang will be damaged.

Scorch: Scorch now has infinite flying time -- he never gets exhausted.

You can also press A + B + X + Y to warp to the next level.

A LAND OF MYSTERY AND MAGIC

Pluto has disappeared but his friend Mickey is looking for him. Mickey follows Pluto's tracks and comes to a magic world filled with climbing plants and strange creatures. But a mysterious, dark shadow watches over the land that isn't as peaceful as it seems like.

On his way through the land Mickey meets a nice, wise old wizard that tells Mickey that the evil emperor Peter has kidnapped poor Pluto. Mickey takes fresh courage and swears to rescue his dog friend and starts walking towards Peter's castle. It won't be an easy task for young Mickey. Emperor Peter has casted a ring of dark magic over the land and everybody knows that he is looking for Mickey!

Mickey has to overcome buzzing bees when he runs and jumps through the mysterious land. When he jumps on their heads they get dizzy. Then Mickey can pick the bees up and throw them away. Look for hearts that keep Mickey's strength on top, because when Mickey looses all his hearts, he has no strength left.

Look out for Emperor Peter's special guards. Use magic or whatever to defeat them and save the land.

Oh no! Pluto is missing and it's up to Mickey to find him. And who could be behind this whole thing? You guessed it, Peg-leg Pete. So now, with the help of a kindly old wizard, Mickey must journey through this game's many levels to find Pluto. Good Luck Mickey, you're gonna need it.

Magical Quest is a fun game that will have you playing for hours (if you want to beat it, that is). The one draw-back of this game is that you cannot save, but thanks to Console Classix, you can use the Save State option. This game has wonderful graphics that are good even for SNES standards, with the magical effects, detailed enemies, and outfits. The music in this game is lively and fun and helps set the mood for the gameplay. So sit down, log in, and have fun.

Directions:

Magical Quest is a fun side-scrolling platform game starring Mickey Mouse on his quest to rescue Pluto from the evil Peg-leg Pete. Run through all six levels which include Treetops, Dark Forest, Fire Grotto, Foothills, Mountains, and Pete's Castle.

Along your way you will pick up items such as coins (which raise you score), fruit (which will give you an extra life if you collect enough), and hearts (which raise your life). Your health is in the upper center of the screen, and your remaining lives are above that. When you run out of lives you can continue, which puts you back at the beginning or the last check point you passed (Don't worry, you have unlimited continues).

Along the way, you will run into a wizard that gives you advice as well as outfits which give you different powers. These outfits are: the magician's outfit, which will let you shoot out a magic bolt; a fireman's outfit, which lets you shoot a spray of water; and a mountain climber's outfit that will let you grapple up the side of a mountain. The outfits and the remaining power of the outfits are on the bottom of the screen. You can also find Genie Lamps, Fire Hydrants, and grappling hooks which replenish your outfit powers.

Run through the levels and fight the bosses at the end of each. The level bosses are Pete in a different form, such as: Worm Pete, Spider Pete, Fire Pete, and Goat Pete. At the end of the game you will fight Peg-leg Pete (which is the hardest fight in the game) and save Pluto. Play alone or with a friend. Two players can take turns playing Mickey when the other dies. So Good Luck, Mickey, and please, save Pluto!

Genre: Movie Adaption
Release Year: 1995
Developer: Black Pearl Software

The Mask is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System side-scrolling action game based on the the first Mask movie. The player controls Stanley Ipkiss, a mild mannered bank clerk who transforms into the namesake character after discovering a green Loki mask. The player has to navigate through an apartment, a high-rent district, outside and inside the bank, the local park, inside a prison, and finally through a ritzy nightclub to fight his evil arch nemesis, Dorian who is also wearing the mask. If the player runs out of health, then he returns to being Ipkiss, wearing his pajamas. Many of The Mask's moves featured in the game were based on scenes in the movie, such as the mallet (which he uses to smash the alarm clock in the movie), the tornado, the massive guns he pulls from his pocket during the final confrontation during the movie, and the huge "living" horn.

It also features other moves, such as a sneaking move which makes The Mask invulnerable (his enemies do not see him), a dash move (as well as a "superdash" move where he runs at supersonic speed), and his primary attack which is a basic punch move with cartoon boxing gloves. Many of the special moves (the mallet, guns, horn, etc.) use The Mask's "Morph" power, which is replenished with power ups. If his morph meter runs out it slowly replenishes to a smaller amount than that he started out with, much like the ammo replenishes for the main gun in Earthworm Jim.

The Ninjawarriors

The evil Banglar and his armies have finally crushed the rebels, yay! No wait, the rebels are the good guys. Oh well, the good guys can't win 'em all. But do not fret, the rebels made three experimental androids that are now programed to assassinate the evil Banglar (don't ask me who programed them, with the rebels dead).

Ninja Warriors is a good video game that is actually the sequel to an arcade model of the same name. The game itself is rather different when it comes to gameplay. For instance, rather then moving up steps and jumping onto platforms, the game now involves side-scrolling action that keeps you on the same level.

The graphics of this game are rather good, with explosions and parts of the background that can be destroyed. The music is good as well, with different tunes for all eight levels and additional scores for the bosses. This game is a beat'em-up at it best, with no thinking involved, just straight beat'em-up.

Directions:

Ninja Warriors is a beat'em-up game in which three android ninjas- Ninja, Kunoichi and Kamaitachi- must fight their way through eight levels in order to get the evil Banglar. Each ninja has different attacks: Kunoichi uses knives and a sword, Ninja uses his fists and nunchuks, and Kamaitachi uses sickles that are attached to his arms.

Each android is also equipped with a blast that knocks everyone down. Fight through each level to get the boss at the end, which is a robot that progressively gets harder as you go up in levels. Sometimes you will be faced off with two large robots. Along with the bosses, there are smaller enemies that you will have to fight as well. The Bosses are larger robots in the sense that they are bigger then you; and watch out, because some of them have special abilities like turning invisible and launching rockets. The best strategy is to run in and beat the crap out of them as quick as you can. Defeat the robots and watch them blow apart with a pretty cool graphics display.

Scattered around each level are objects that you can pick up and throw at enemies. Be sure to keep an eye on your health which is at the bottom of the screen; if it runs out, you blow up. Don't worry, though, you can pick up energy packs along your way, and if that fails you have unlimited lives, and you get the chance to choose another of the three androids or keep the same one. All in all, this game is worth playing and beating, considering that you can keep playing without running out of lives. So plug in and play away!

A short yet sweet adventure from the perspective of one of those jumpy little guys from SMB2.

Developer: Jaleco

_________________________
*
The year is 2015. After the economic wars of 2011, most of the free world has become a commodity to be bought and sold for profit. Many companies had been fighting for the Earth's resources, but one company rose to the top. That company was Deutchland Moldavia.

By buying up most of the Earth's remaining resources, DM became a power stronger than any Government. At first, DM claimed peace and prosperity as its goals. But as the challenges in uniting a planet grew more difficult, the President of DM, a man named Trip Iago, became delirious with the power he had gained.

DM had always been involved in research on many levels. But Mr. Iago had big plans for his company. By working on a type of genetic manipulation, DM learned how to change a human into a mindless slave or a powerful being.

Four people were affected by DM's evil research: Flynn, Echo, Al, and Prokop. Each one found reasons to seek revenge on DM. After the harm DM had done, all four swore that they would stop DM, even if it meant their own destruction. 

~From the Manual

Gameplay:

A one to two player game (four player for versus mode), The Peace Keepers spans multiple endings along with having multiple paths to take during the course of the game. There are six selectable characters in the game. The game is not exactly presented in 2.5D form like its predecessors, but instead presented in ? view and plays out like any other brawler or beat em up would. You run through a slew of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The controls are the standard punch, special attack, taunt, jump and block. Using taunt followed by your special move button allows for a super move to be used. The bosses you face and when you meet them depend on the paths you take through out the game.

Tips:

Both players can choose the same character
Highlight 1P game, hold L, R, & Down both controllers.  The cursor should then be in '2P Game', press start on controller 1

Secret Move
If Flynn's energy is below 10%, he can turn into his fire haired superhuman mode. Hold R, and press Down, Down + Right, Right, and X

Start Story Mode with All Six Characters
At the Jaleco Logo, hold L, R, A and press START. Hold the buttons down as the game starts

Secret Character
If you go up to the door at the end of the first stage without going in, then return to the beginning, you will find a secret character

Stalag 17 Warp
If you go up to the door at the end of the Roy D Tutto Hospital stage without going in, then return to the manhole you passed in the street, you will find it is open. It is a shorcut to the Stalag 17 stage

Weird death
If you play as Prokop up to the Ozymandias stage, then play as any other character on that stage, Prokop will be killed when you go down the flight of stairs.

The watery world of Mer is threatened by the deadly Dark Water. Prince Ren and his companions must find the Treasures of Rule to control the Dark Water and return Mer to its former glory. Always hot on their heels is the evil pirate-lord Bloth who wants to find the treasures to rule over Mer.

Based on a cartoon series by the same name, The Pirates of Dark Water is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Final Fight or Streets of Rage.

The player chooses a character, from among Prince Ren and his two companions Tula and Ioz, who differ in strength and agility, but who use the same basic attacks. There are two attack buttons, one for fast attacks and combinations and one for a single heavy attack. Other controls include: blocking attacks, grabbing and throwing opponents, dash attacks while running, and a special attack that hits multiple enemies consuming life energy at the same time. Most levels also require you to avoid obstacles like chasms, falling rocks or spikes that shoot out of the ground.

_________________________

"Happy Happy Joy Joy? Not Really"

Ren & Stimpy license games have always been rather weak. When the BEST game in the series is Veediots, a very average platformer, you know you're in trouble. But some of them, like Buckeroo$, are so horrible that you wonder if the games ever got tested for quality control.

1) Graphics. Bland. Backgrounds are cartoony but are possess little creativity, and are recycled ad nauseum throughout the whole game. Animations are extremely weak; most movements consist of two or three frames, all of which are ugly. I'm amazed John K., a guy who favors full animation, allowed such limited and stiff movements.

2) Sound. TURN THE VOLUME DOWN! I swear, this game has some of the most pathetic sound design I've ever heard in any game. It has less than a half dozen melodies TOTAL, all of which are not only repeated for multiple levels but which are extremely short and begin looping after about 15 seconds. Oh, so you like "Happy Happy Joy Joy"? Not after you hear it for the 29 billionth time. And the choice of musical instruments is appalling as well. Everything sounds empty and seems to use the same irritating trumpets over and over. Voice bytes sound NOTHING like the show, especially Stimpy's voice.

3) Controls. They're bad, plain and simple. Ren & Stimpy both walk by default, which is agonizingly slow and lethargic. There IS a run button, but the programmers stupidly placed it on the X Button, making for some unnatural reaching.

4) Gameplay. Here's the gameplay in a nutshell: Go from left to right, slap some bad guys (or in Stimpy's case, belch hairballs), hop from platform to platform here and there, rinse, repeat. Nothing even remotely original or enthralling exists here, especially since the pace of the game is tortuously SLOW and boring. And the A.I. is cheap, because it takes a ton of hits to kill some of them (such as the sheriff of Dodge City), all while they beat you to nearly dead.

As if the game engine wasn't bad enough, there are only three variations of level themes in the game: Western, medieval, and space. And the space levels are awful; it tries to pull a Lemmings, wherein your protect Ren while he wanders aimlessly around the ship. But after about a minute of this, you'll want the suffering to stop.

5) Overall. This game is a sad, sad "effort" that puts the Ren & Stimpy name to shame. It reeks of executives trying to cash in on a popular craze without taking any time to work on it, and the uber repetitive backgrounds/level design, snail-speed gameplay pace, uninspired, ridiculously repeated enemies, and never-ending music will all make you want to pull your hair out. Even if you find this game for $1 at a bargain bin, don't even think about picking it up.

Fire Dogs was more of a puzzle game than an action game as violence was few and far in-between and the goal was the sneak out of the fire station before time ran out. If time ran out or if the fireman caught the player, then he would lose a life. Nintendo Power once claimed that the time limit was too strict and the AI was not complex enough.

"To all Ren and Stimpy fans, do not play this game"

I wonder what was THQ on when they made this game. There was 4 Ren and Stimpy games for the Super Nintendo and I personally think that the games was pretty awful but this one takes the cake in my opinion. Poor graphics, poor gameplay and the horrible controls is what makes this game awful.

Story: Ren and Stimpy needed to find 47 million (that's way too much) proof of purchases to get a time machine so they can go back in time. Whatever, that's just a very bad story, but then again all Ren and Stimpy games have bad stories. Story gets a 1/10.

Sound/Music: The music is just one tune that plays over and over again. It is horrible. Get some CDs out if you manage to play through this "game". Be prepared to hear lots of screaming, burping and "Joy". Those are basically the only sound effects you will find in the game. Sound/Music gets a 1/10.

Controls: Horrible. Most of the time you can't get Ren and Stimpy to respond. It takes more than a few taps on the buttons just to get them to move. And they don't jump high enough either. They are slow, slow, slow. Control gets a 1/10.

Graphics: The only good thing about the game. Ren and Stimpy look exactly like their cartoon counterpart. The backgrounds weren't the best looking but then again, the show itself have horrible animation so I guess the backgrounds fit in to match the show. Graphics gets a 6/10.

Game Play: A mess. You play as both Ren and Stimpy. It's ridiculous. You have to find 47 million Gritty Kitty proof of purchases (which there are not 47 million proof of purchases in the game). You don't even finish the game because they don't find enough Gritty Kitty proof of purchases. Plus Ren and Stimpy keep dying a lot. The controls are so unresponsive it mostly interferes with the game play. Game Play gets a 1/10.

Comedy: This game's control, music and sound and game play is so horrible, it's funny. (Will not be counted in scoring)

Challenge: Way too challenging for such a short game.

Replay Value: I never would play this garbage again.

Buy/Rent/Avoid: Avoid at all times. Don't even bother buying it.

Pros
Great comedy
The graphics

Cons
everything else

The Total
Story:1/10
Sound/Music:1/10
Control: 1/10
Graphics: 6/10
Game Play: 1/10

The Final Total: A 2.

Conclusion: Ren and Stimpy was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid and the game doesn't really give it any justice. Even if you are a big fan for Ren and Stimpy, I wouldn't recommend this game to you unless you plan on playing a bad game.

The plot of Veediots! is virtually nonexistent, due to the fact that all four levels are separate stories based on episodes of the TV series:

 - The Boy Who Cried Rat!: Ren evades Stimpy in the living room, then tries to survive in Stimpy's mouth and defeat the Tooth Beaver (referencing Ren's Toothache).
 - In The Army: Ren runs amuck at boot camp's training grounds, and finally faces the drill sergeant.
 - Stimpy's Invention: Stimpy must go through his lab collecting certain items within the time limit.
 - Marooned: Stimpy must survive inside the esophagus and belly of a space alien.

Tips:

Level Select
When the title screen appears, quickly press L, R, A, L, R, L, B, R, X BEFORE the word 'Veediots!' fully appears

Hear the Whole Theme Song
At the beginning of the game, the theme song plays for awhile and then fades away once the demos begin.

"About as fun as a root canal"

One of those typical Disney videogames with the exception of decent graphics and sound. This game plain and simple stinks. The stages are either incredibly easy or extremely difficult so there is no balance and the story is more difficult to understand than one of those bums who ask you for ''fiddy cent'' when you are in the ghetto.

Story: 1/10 - I never saw the movie, and after playing the game, I still have no idea what the hell happened. All you can piece from the game is that there is a plane race that you have to win, you have to fly through the sky and avoid paratroopers, and you have to fight on a Zepplin at some point. Most pornfilms have better plots than this game (and probably the movie too).

Gameplay: 1/10 - The gameplay is horrid for the most part. In the first stage, it is nearly impossible to navigate your plane around the poles unless you look at the much smaller screen in the bottom. Why is there a 3-D enviroment on a 2-D screen? Makes about as much sense getting locked in the bathroom and peeing your pants. The worst part is the fist fight at the end, in which you basically have nothing else in your arsenal than a simple punch. If the Rocketeer had to fight someone who had a kick or two in their arsenal, he'd get worked.

Sound: 3/10 - Not bad, but not great either. For an SNES game it is decent. Not much you can say about the sound though since it's not memorable and there are no special sound effects.

Graphics: 4/10 - Decent graphics at best. You can make out the figures and all, but the backgrounds are nothing spectacular, which is not a good thing since most games take the time to make the background pleasing to your eyes. To put it bluntly, I've Gameboy games with nicer backgrounds.

Replay Value: 1/10 - Getting rid of this game is actually more fun than playing the game, trust me. You will be delightfully amused at throwing away the cartridge or tossing the ROM in the recycling bin.

Final Thought: I remember getting this game as a birthday gift quite some time ago, I also remember selling the game back to the same guy (Sam Pai) who gave it to me about a week later. It was probably the best 2 dollars I ever spent in my life.

Bart Simpson falls asleep while studying and wakes up in a strange universe where TVs and fairies roam the streets. The player must find Bart's lost homework and progress through the various levels to keep the homework pages and eventually return to reality.

The game is split in two parts. The first is set on a street (probably Evergreen Terrace, but referred to as Windy World). Bart walks around and has to find pages of his homework while avoiding enemies such as living post boxes and various characters from the show. Bart can collect his skateboard, which acts as a power-up and temporarily increases the player's speed. Jimbo and his gang would coerce Bart into strolling with them, to which Bart would lose control of his movements and have to move with them, even having to take damage. If Bart touched a flying saxophone, Lisa Simpson with pixie wings would sprinkle fairy dust on Jimbo and his gang and transform them into rats, freeing Bart. However, if Bart is by himself, the Lisa pixie would turn him into a frog, where the frog Bart could not attack. If Bart caught a kiss blown to him by an old lady, it would revert him to his human form. Bart would also have to use bubble gum to blow a bubble to repel enemies as well as collect floating Z's. 

An important trick would be to catch Z's at opposite ends of the game screen which served as "goal posts", thus extending the level of play in the game.

Principal Skinner occasionally appears and tries to dress Bart in his Sunday suit. If the player walks into Skinner, Bart will change appearance and become very slow and not be able to fire at enemies, however the suit will also protect Bart from all enemies and he will not take damage.

Tips:

Extra Lives in Itchy and Scratchy Game
Go to the lamp and get the weapon by it, then shoot the thing that the lamp throws out and they turn into lives. You can get 3 lives this way.

Skateboarding Bart
To get Bart to ride a skateboard, jump over a basketball in the main area. He can find papers faster this way.

Conceived partly as an Olympics tie-in, and partly as a stop-gap for James Pond fans (the third platform title in the series (Operation Starfish) was in the process of being heavily delayed, eventually being released in 1994), this game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.

Most events had some sort of twist to them, to make them fit the underwater theme, or the style of humour seen in the James Pond series. The 100-metre-splash is similar to joystick-waggling games of the 80s but also involves making timed jumps to hit seagulls. More unusual is Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals. There's also gymnastics, unicycle-riding, and a hurdles race of sorts. The events can be played by up to 4 players.

The Terminator is an action shooter game. The main character, Kyle Reese, traverses through levels that closely parallel the movie's environment. In all levels, the main character has a jump and has various weapons throughout the game. The first level takes place in the future and the main character has hand grenades, timed bombs, and a machine gun as weapon choices. The later levels take place in modern settings and the primary weapon is a shotgun only. The final level takes place inside the Cyberdyne factory, where you battle the Terminator alone. The objective of this level is to lead the Terminator into a compactor which destroys him.

The Tick
Platform: Super NES

Genre: Beat 'em Up
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Software Creations
Publisher: Fox Interactive
_________________________
*
The game's style is very typical for this side-scrolling genre. The Tick's signature humor is also present in various parts of the game, such as his unorthodox gestures and "Spoon!" battle cry after completing a level (or starting a level in the Mega Drive version). Forty-four levels make up the game with "wobble" environments and arcade style graphics.

However, in contrast to the popular animated series it is based on, the Tick video game was met with overwhelmingly negative criticism. While the accurate graphics and jazzy background music are moderately well received, many gamers dislike the seemingly endless supply of look-a-like enemies and the limited punch-and-kick style gameplay. The game ending is also widely regarded as empty and unrewarding. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame called The Tick "repetitive" and "boring."

Tips:

Skip Current Level
Press L + R during gameplay.

Stage select
Set the following options: Lives-7, Continues-4, Arthurs-2, Test sound-Teleport. Then press start during gameplay.

The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA

Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Red Entertainment
Publisher: Bullet Proof Software
_________________________
*
The game is the sequel of a TurboGrafx-16 game titled Makai Prince Dorabochan.

The game follows the adventures of a young vampire, the title character Spike McFang, who is set to battle with the evil zombie general Von Hessler, who attempts to invade his parents' and his friend Camelia's kingdoms. The game plays from a top-down perspective; the player encounters several enemies in the game and by defeating them, can gain experience points and increase his level. Spike's main weapons are his cape, that attacks in a short range (though Spike can extend its range at the risk of dizzying himself for a short time) and his hat, which can be thrown like a boomerang. He is also able to utilize magical cards with a wide variety of special effects, including, but not limited to:

 - Invisibility
 - Summoning angels and bats
 - Turning all foes into small, furry animals
 - Grabbing a balloon and floating to safety.
 - Elemental Attacks
 - Powered up parter
 - Recovering Health

The American release was edited to be more family friendly, replacing Spike's penchant for eating creatures' hearts to regain health with a hunger for tomatoes.

Tips:

Play As Rudy
Go to the title screen and press Down, B, Left, B, Up, Y, Right, Y. If the trick worked, you'll hear a chime.  Now when you beat Felina, Rudy comes to your rescue. As you return to town, you can control him with Controller Two.

2.The Warehouse: As Ness you must shoot guys who have information regarding Capone and pick up the information they drop when they have been shot.

3.The Bridge: This is the first level in which The Untouchables (Stone, Malone, Wallace, and Ness) are the playable characters. As the Untouchables you blow up some of Capone's drug trafficking trucks.

4.The Alley: This level is very similar to The Streets, however, you have the option to switch between Ness and the Untouchables.

5.The Train Station: As Ness you must guide a baby-carriage down a flight of stairs while fighting off Capone's henchmen.

6.The Hostage: One of Capone's henchmen has taken a man for a hostage, Capone's bookkeeper and possible witness, and while controlling George Stone you must take one shot to take out the henchman.

7.The Rooftops: Another level that is similar to The Streets except you must reload your own gun in between shots while you take cover behind a courthouse wall. This level is a confrontation between Eliot and Capone's assassin and enforcer, Frank Nitti.

The object in the game is to defeat the Wicked Witch of the West that is trying to take Dorothy's ruby slippers so that Dorothy can return to Kansas.

Dorothy Gale travels to places like Shy Village (unnamed in the movie), Gamboge Gorge (a desert scene not used in the movie), Maize Meadow (possibly a reference to the corn field that the Scarecrow can be found in the film), Saffron Fields, Xanith Farms, Citron City (not used in the film), The Red Country (not used in the film), and Cinnibar City (yet again, something that is not present in the movie).

Then it veers off into other stages that are exclusive to the video game version (except for the Emerald City and the poppy fields (where the Wicked Witch tried to poison Dorothy and crew to sleep in the movie}, that was in the film version also, and is the original point of the story to get to the Emerald City).

Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

A super-powered starship is under attack by various space prostitues, and the pilot has to maneuver it over all sorts of terrain to make it out alive. He struggles with riddles and games to try to get past the prostitutes. They are very deceiving, as space aliens are, for they may look good until they are completely exposed. Some come equipped with a second set of jaws! Eight intergalactic stages make up the action in this fierce test of strength and agility. You'll have lots of powerful weapons to help you along the way, but firestorms and dangerous enemies should provide ample challenges to keep you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think you've made it through a level, you'll encounter gruesome boss characters that'll make you wish you were already dead. It's going to be one heck of a battle, but if you can buckle down and use your head, you might just live to tell about it. --Box Summary

There are 8 levels in Thunder Spirits, each consisting of the ship battling numerous enemies while side-scrolling, usually with a "mini-boss" about halfway through the level. Then, at the end of each level, a boss (consisting of one or two enemies) appears, which must be defeated before preceding to the next level. Throughout the level, the ship can pick up "Weapon upgrades"; and the player is able to switch between any of up to 5 weapons at any time.

Tips:

Extra Continues
On the title screen, press B as fast as possible. A metal-like sound will play every time you earn a continue.

Extra Configuration Options
After beating the game, check the configuration screen (Select + Start on the title screen), and extra options will be added to the menu, ranging from number of reserve ships to a Sound Test. The game needs to be beaten on Maniac level. Other levels are unconfirmed.

The game takes place in 2045, when the Tiamatians, intelligent alien beings from planet Tiamat, discover a sort of space-time portal -or "rift", as it is called in the game- that interconnects their homeworld with Earth. Meanwhile, human astronomers discover the same rift, but are not aware of the existence of Tiamat. They also discover that the rift is growing in a geometric rate. As they try to study it, the Tiamatians launch an exploratory probe, named "Torquemada II", in order to find a planet similar to Tiamat; the probe soon finds Earth and sends information back to Tiamat.

As Earth astronomers continue studying the space-time rift in 2047, the Tiamat leadership agrees to send explorers to Earth. It turns out that Tiamatians are planning to conquest Earth to convert it into "Tiamat II". However, Tiamatians have learned that humans have highly developed fighting skills and a vast amount of weapons, and they obviously would not agree to be enslaved. Because the power of the human defense forces, they decide to change their strategy, abandoning a conventional, frontal attack on Earth forces (because they would likely face a high casualty rate and even a defeat) in favor of a plan focusing on a time-traveling technology. This plan consists in sending Tiamatian expeditionary forces to several historic ages, in order to interfere with the development of human weaponry. By doing this, they can secure a victory by truncating the evolution of human weapons, leaving humankind with nothing but weak weapons and at the mercy of Tiamatian forces in the future. 

But their carefully planned strategy has a flaw: it failed to take in count the human intellect.

As Tiamat expeditionary forces are dispatched, a group of scientists led by Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh unveils the prototype of a time-travelling machine. Suddenly, Tiamatians launch an attack on the laboratory where Dr. Gilgamesh works; all but Dr. Gilgamesh are killed. Without having time to test the time-traveling machine, he decides to travel back in time to stop Tiamat's conquest plans. A battle between Dr. Gilgamesh and Tiamatians starts, and it is only a matter of time to decide who shall win.

"Traveling around in time on the SNES"

Introduction

This is a game based on a movie, I believe. Whatever it is or not, the game is not that really good anyways. Its you're slightly below average adventure game with some cops guy that is equipped with some meek pistol that shoots his opponents.

Released in 1995, this game has some good looking graphic technology, which differ from the other games o nthe SNES. This is what I first noticed when I play the game; that is smooth and very good looking.

But there are many other flaws in this game that makes it bad. Such as what, you may ask me. Well, not so fun gameplay for certainly. And then you have so-so music and very cheap sounding sound effects in the game.

Gameplay

The gameplay for this game is not fun, to put bluntly. Most of the time you'll be running around in the game looking for ammos for you meekly looking pistol that doesn't do alot of damage. Ammos is hard to come by in this game and that you'll be looking for it very often. So you can conclude that ammo is a very hard commodity in this game and that it should be reserved alot.

So much of the time when you're controling this time cop, you'll be jumping and dodging the bullets that got ziz over your head. Oh yeah, you can also punch in the game (no kicking or throws, just punches) but it isn't very effective in the game. For example, when you're trying to punch the guy in the game, but you mis-timd your aim and that he walked straight into you... well, you lost a chunk of your health.

What I noticed that this game is indeed very hard. Most of the time you'll notice yourself playing the same level over and over game, trying to beat the stage because you'll be losing your health so much. The game developer, to bluntly put it, made this game so damn hard.

The enemies in this game includes humans and robots. The human enemies are equipped with guns and fists to knoc you out. The robots are simply annoying little objects that tries to 'hit' you. This means just moving in a very slowly velocity and trying to touch you. You know what this means? You lost health! What a terrible game design.

Graphic

LIke I said, the graphic in this game is very good. The texture in the game stimules 'real' texture in the game as close as possible to the SNES's processing ability as you can get. The skin on the human character, your main character in which you're controlling, looks real.

The level design that makes this game is like the other dozens of adventure game for the SNES. Why? because it's design and is done time and time over again. Jump this place. Avoid the little spikey thing over there. Including the robot. And yes, don't jump on the pit or you'll die for sure.

Like I said before, because of the level design that made this game very frustating. I think the game developer made this game alot of CHALLENGING, to the point that it is difficult to complete this game.

Conclusion

Time Cop, based on a movie is yet another horrible translation from movie to video games. I don't like it, and I don't think you should waste your play and time playing this game either. Perhaps you should give it a try if you want to see how mundane it is.

Tips:

Cheat Mode
At the title screen, press A, B, X, Y, A, B, X, Y, and Start

Genre: Puzzle
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Software Creations
Publisher: Nintendo
_________________________
*
The game is set in a place called the Ol' West, which was inhabited by robots. The main protagonist is a mechanical sheriff name Tin Star, who has a side kick name Mo Crash. In the beginning, Tin Star and Mo rode on a stagecoach to a town called East Driftwood to stop the Bad Oil Gang and their leader, Black Bart, from committing crimes. While riding on a stagecoach, a member of the Bad Oil Gang wearing spring shoes name Joe Twiddley saw them inside of the stagecoach and tried to attack them along with his gang, but Tin Star defeated them, and made it to East Driftwood safely. Upon their arrival, the story begins when Tin Star tried to help the old lady carry her bags, while she pushed him away from her and made him accidentally step on and broke a potted plant won by Tiny Johnson at a contest.

Gameplay:

Tin Star was designed to be compatible not only with a standard Super NES controller, but also with the Super Scope and the SNES Mouse. The gameplay contains levels titled as "days". Each day is filled with four types of screens called "scenes".

Scenes:

 - Training - Each day begins with a training session. Players can practice their gunslinging and try to rack up as much money as possible. Players can also test their aim by shooting the jugs on the screen. A jug will twirl up into the air when shot. As the jug comes down, players must shoot it again to "juggle" it and rack up loads of cash. A jug will break if it hits the bottom of the screen. The color of the jug also changes and will break when it becomes red for a while.

 - Action - In this type of scene, players must fight their way through such scenes as cattle stampedes, a train, a bank robbery, barroom brawls, jail breaks, etc, while shooting the members of the Bad Oil Gang as they appear on the screen. Some Action screens are first-person viewed, while some are third-person viewed. If players let them stay on the screen too long, they will shoot Tin Star. Players can shoot canteens to restore health. Some targets can be shot for extra money. Some of the action screens will also have a boss at the end of each third-person viewed, Action screen.

 - Showdown - At the end of each day, players usually have to face one member of the Bad Oil Gang in an old-fashioned quick draw gunfight. As players face down their adversary, they must watch for the "Draw" icon, which is shaped like the cylinder of a revolver, to appear. Players must quickly shoot the icon, and then shoot the opponent as fast as possible. Speed and accuracy are the most important in this scene.

 - Bonus Screens - To access these, players should not shoot a single canteen. The bonus screen shows a woman spinning around on a round board with stars next to her body. Shooting the stars without missing and without accidentally shooting the woman will help players pick up large amounts of money. Bonus screens cannot be accessed after completing each Showdown screen.

Tips:

Changing Tin Star's color
At the title screen, when you start a new game, press A, B, X, or Y to change Tin Star's color.

A Blue Tin Star
Y Normal Tin Star
B Silver Tin Star
X Teal Tin Star

Secret Bonus
To earn a chance at the Secret Bonus in a level, simply beat the level without shooting a single health canteen. Sounds simple, but it was very difficult to figure it out!

HI! Welcome to Tiny Toon Adventures for the Super NES. I'm Buster Bunny, and I'll be your host through this tour.

First, we'll go to ACME Looniversity, where my friends and I go to school. It's a great place to learn from some of the best teachers around.

We will also go out to a town in the Old West. I'll be Sheriff Buster Bunny--the long arm of the law--and I'll have to do my gol'darndest to keep Montana Max from ruining the town.

There is also a picnic break to get some chow. I hope that doesn't get rained out, but I'm sure we can find shelter if it does.

The next stage takes us to Acme Acres Stadium. I, being a great athlete, will show off my amazing football talents.

The fifth stage takes us on a hunt for Calamity Coyote's hidden treasure. This will be a chance to get some fresh air.

Finally, Princess Babs Bunny (no relation!) of the Kingdom of Acme is kidnapped by the Milky Way Imperial Army. But don't worry, we'll rescue her. Make way for Buster Bunny, Knight of Honor!

--From the SNES Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose! instruction manual.

Gameplay:

This game features Buster Bunny in a side-scrolling adventure that takes place in many different areas. The game has three difficulty settings - "Children" (easy), "Normal", and "Challenge" (hard). On the easy mode, the levels are significantly reduced in size (as noted in the synopsis below), while the hard mode has Buster start each level with only one health unit.

TNN Bass Tournament of Champions
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Fishing
Release Year: 1994
Developer: American Softworks
Publisher: American Softworks
_________________________
*
The object of the game is to catch as much large bass as possible so that the player can advance through the tournaments and eventually win the championship. The player has from sunrise to sunset to fish, thus giving him the necessary time to develop strategies related to participating in a virtual fishing derby. Changes in the season and the weather will try to impede the player's progress as he attempts to win the championship.

Other fish (besides bass) can be accidentally caught as well, but they will not count towards the final score. Only bass will count towards the player's progression throughout the game. During the 1990s, this game attracted rural and suburban teenagers (who usually ignored The Nashville Network's more bucolic-oriented shows like The Real McCoys and the Grand Ole Opry).

Tommy Moe's Winter Extreme Skiing and Snowboarding
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Skiing
Release Year: 1994
Developer: Loriciel
Publisher: Electro Brain
Players: 1
_________________________
*
This game uses skiing and snowboarding as extreme sports in either freestyle, training mode, or competition mode. Competition mode allows the player to have 3 (three) chances to successfully complete the challenges. Otherwise, he or she gets the game over screen advising the player to start over again. The freestyle mode plays like a video arcade racing game, the training mode allows the player to use any course, and the competition mode is like the Winter Olympic Games. Controls can be modified and the player can either use skis or snowboards. The game is named after legendary skier Tommy Moe.

Conditions can change on the course, which can range from dawn, dusk, darkness, afternoon conditions, even a snowstorm. Once the player reaches the bottom of the hill in freestyle mode, either he or she must use the ski lift in order to climb to the top of the next mountain. There are less than 70 seconds to get to the next checkpoint. The fastest speed that snowboards can go is 66 miles per hour (106.2 kilometres per hour) on hilly terrain and 88 miles per hour (141.6 kilometres per hour) on flat terrain. These factors make them ? as fast as NASCAR stock cars. A password allows players to continue their saved progress as they explore new regions of the mountain and refine their skiing or snowboarding skills.

Top Gear, as the name suggests, is a car racing game. Race against the clock and a field of computer-controlled drivers to see if you can become the ultimate racing champion. Or play with a friend and show off your track burning skills.

Top Gear's graphics if not perfect are certainly more than adequate, the sound effects are good and the music, unlike most video games of this type, is actually worth listening to, and won't drive you mad while you race. Plus it's a pretty comprehensive racing simulator without getting so bogged down in realism that it takes all the fun out of it.

Directions:

Top Gear is one of the most fun games I've played in a while. First of all you get to choose which kind of car you want to drive. Will you go for the highest top speed, maximum acceleration, or try a balanced approach? Also you can choose an auto transmission or take ultimate control over your machine and choose manual drive.

As the tracks get longer you'll need to watch your fuel gauge and time your pit stops carefully. Will a quarter of a tank get you through the race, or will you have to give up a few positions to finish at all?

Thankfully you won't crash and burn if you bump a barrier or another vehicle, but any contact except where your tires meet pavement will slow you down, so be careful! And when the road ahead is clear, hit the Nitro for a powerful boost of speed! Now you're really in Top Gear! 

Controls:

X Button - Accelerate
Y Button - Brake
A Button - Nitro
B Button - Input Options
L Button - Gear Down
R Button - Gear Up
Start Button - Start Game, Input Options
Select Button - Select Options, Pause Race

Tips:

Fuel Up Faster
Whenever you enter the pit stop, hold up

Race in Any Country Without Completing the Stages At the 'select country' screen choose the United Kingdom (UK) as your destination, then type in the following code to play any country you wish:

VALHALLA
Get 1st place and 2nd place at the same time.  This glitch might be a little hard to do at first, but with a little practice you should be able to easily pull it off on every level. On your last lap, when you are nearing the finish line simply make half of your car (go fast) run into the finishing line. Because of this, the front part of the car will cross (giving you 1st place) and than the car will bounce back and go forward again (giving you 2nd place too).

Ah, car racing. A sport that never goes out of style, and a game that simulates it. You are a driver in this game. Race down the track at supersonic speed and earn money to pimp your ride. Use nitros to burst past opponents with huge amounts of speed. Win the race. Beat out the world's best.

My bro rented this when I was 8 or 9. When I first saw it, I thought he had borrowed an N64 or something. The graphics were that darn good. For a guy who grew up playing SNES until he got an N64 at age 13. Either way, this game is a sweet racer and I suggest.. no, I recommend... no, I demand you play this game! It's that darn good!

Directions:

Race your racecar among 19 others and win.

Controls:

A Button - Shoots Nitro
B Button - Brake, chooses options
X Button - Accelerates
Y Button - Brake
Start Button - Goes to menu from start screen

Hints:

Using Nitro
Only use nitros when the race begins, and on straight stretches. Because if you use the Nitros at the beginning, you'll be able to go through a lot of other cars, and go up the ranks faster. Be careful, because if you hit someone on the way through, it goes on your car as damage, and your car's top speed goes down. And on straight stretches, use them. Because if you use Nitros on curves, you'll risk hitting objects and losing valuable time.

Your car isn't like an anti virus program with updates.
If you buy a part for a car, make sure you get the best one right away. This minimizes cost but it'll be harder because you're still working with the factory stock parts going up into the more experienced drivers. But remember, if you've got an upgrade, never ever select the stock item, because this will give your upgrade away, and you won't get any money back.

In Total Carnage, an evil Middle Eastern dictator named General Akhboob closes off his country to the rest of the world following a war in 1999. Hundreds of reporters flocked to the zone in hopes of getting a real scoop. Unfortunately for them, one of the reporters discovers that there's more than baby milk being made at the 'Baby Milk Factory'. General Akhboob kills the reporter and captures all the remaining reporters in his country. It turns out that General Akhboob has been building an army of mutants and a stockpile of chemical weapons. He's also holding several American reporters and other civilians captive. It is up to the Doomsday Squad, composed of Captain Carnage (Player 1) and Major Mayhem (Player 2), to invade Akhboob's base, wipe out his forces, destroy the mutants, rescue all the hostages and capture Akhboob.

Along the way, Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem fight various mutants and monsters, a giant mutant cyborg named Orcus, and eventually General Ahkboob himself. Ahkboob transforms into several forms, including a series of three giant heads. After his defeat, he attempts to escape by releasing a swarm of copies, but is captured and executed by electric chair.

The Doomsday Squad then decides to take a military leave to the Midway Pleasure Domes, a grotesque amusement park. The player(s) can only access this area if they collected 220 keys during the game.

Jon Hey followed up his sound creation for Smash TV with the sound and music for Total Carnage. Ed Boon, who created Mortal Kombat for Midway along with John Tobias, was the voice of General Akhboob.

You are Woody, a cowboy doll who has come to life in a room full of toys that have come alive too. You've got a pretty nice life, keeping the toys in line, and making sure nothing bad happens. Everything is going great for you until a new toy shows up. He's so cool, all the other toys like him more than they like you. One day, your owner, 6 year old Andy, is going to Pizza Planet, and he wants to bring this new toy. So, in an act of jealousy, you try to get rid of him by knocking him behind a drawer. But it backfires and you send him out the window! Now the toys hate you. Can you get the new toy back and regain the other toys' respect?

I'm a fan of Toy Story. I'm sure several of you are too. This game is a very addicting one, and a very challenging one. The music is very good, and it doesn't sound too scratchy like in some of the other games. You get to play along with the movie, although it has some added elements to make the game more challenging and longer, thus taking away its accuracy to the movie. I'll tell you what else makes this game cool - it has several modes of play! There are levels where you are above the action, and one level where it's first-person! But there's a lot of screen-scrolling, so get used to that.

Directions:

You're trying to rescue the great Buzz Lightyear, a toy that took your place as Andy's favorite toy. Even though you hate him, you must work with him if you want to get back to Andy in one piece. And there are a lot of things that are going to give you death instead of help. A claw machine, Sid, Sid's evil dog Scud, and a deadly rocket that is taped to Buzz Lightyear's back. Also, you can't save your progress, so once you're dead, you start from the beginning. But you get a certain amount of lives and hit points in each life to beat every level, and eventually, you can earn continues. Plus you have Rex, the not-so-terrifying toy dinosaur, your pull-string (which you use as your only weapon) Roller-bob, and eventually, Buzz Lightyear himself. How? Well, watch the movie or go and hit the "Play Now" button and play the game to find out.

Controls:

A Button - Whip
B Button - Jump
X Button - Whip
Y Button - Jump
Start Button - Skip storyline, Pause

Hints:

Extra Lives:

Want an extra 2 lives? Want to make the game more challenging? Go to Options and hit down on the down key. You'll see how many lives you'll start with. You can change them to increase or decrease the difficulty. 

Tips:

Level Passwords:
251324 Level 2
421553 Level 3
343435 Level 4
151423 Level 5

Invincibility
In The First Level, You will Come upon a dresser with an army man basket on top of it. There will also be a bouncy ball on the left of the dresser. If you have 5 lives in the top right corner (Displayed within the cowboy star), jump on to the bottom ledge of the dresser (Bottom shelf), Now duck until the cowboy star begins to spin. You are now invincible.

Stage Skip
Enter the invincibility code. Press start to pause the game, and press select to skip to the end of the current stage.

An irresponsible young man wouldn't take over the company and now his father is dying. In order to get his young adult son to accept his new responsibilities, the father must force him to reclaim his toy factory from a strait-laced Army sergeant that he has appointed as part of a "test of maturity." This results in the player being involved in a "toy war" between an army of military-style toys; these special kind of wars are fought with his or her own personalized action figure army using toys found in certain places in the game.

The player will start each level only possessing a limited supply of toys, whereas the sergeant will have a virtually unlimited supply of toys to throw at the player. Only with skillful strategy can the toy factory be reclaimed from its authoritarian factory manager.

One of those games Square never released in the United States!

Translation Description: 

This new patch includes some new fonts and fixes a bug that happened at Herman's Cave if you read the Notebook for the first time at the door. Some names have also been reworked. But seeing that Metalhawk hasn't tested the patch properly, he still considers it incomplete.

Tips:

Frog Casino-Secret Area
In the grand Frog Casino at the Port City of Akrass (the first town of the third island), there is a golden frog statue. Talking to it will bring up a dialog asking for a secret code. It will ask for a four-character/digit code.

In the Japanese game the three options are all katakana syllables. The idea is to spell out 'KE' 'RO' 'KE' 'RO' ('kerokero' = the Japanese equivalent of 'ribbit').

In the English patched version, the choices correspond to '3' '1' '3' '1' for the code (or, basically, the third, first, third and first options, on each dialog respectively).

Once you enter the code, the statue will open its jaws and you can walk into it to find a secret basement area with more game tables to play at.

Treasure of the Rudras
Platform: Super NES
Region: Japan (Translated)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Role Playing Game
Release Year: 2006
Original Title: Rudra no Hihou
Translated By: Aeon Genesis
Version: 2.00
_________________________
*
Treasure of the Rudras was the first and last game by director Keita Amamiya, responsible for the Kamen Rider series, as well as Zeiram and some other things. Popular belief holds that Amamiya was fired by Squaresoft for making such a bad game. I find this very difficult to believe. I mean, it's a pretty decent game, for one thing, and I think that if a game really was that bad, and it actually was the fault of the director, it probably wouldn't have gotten, you know, released. Anyways.

Rudra here was one of Squaresoft's last releases for the Super Famicom, and looks very much like every other post-FFVI RPG of Square's. The music is very catchy, having been done by the same guy who composed the soundtracks for all the Gameboy SaGa games. Hell, some of the tracks are downright fantastic. Naturally, it's Rudra's graphical and musical excellence (and the simple fact that it's a Japan-only Squaresoft game) that have propelled it to "underrated gem" status.

There's three chapters, involving three different people, that can be played in any order, and you can stop one and start another one as easily as hitting Reset (and possibly saving beforehand). In the fourth chapter, all three characters band together, and go fight the ultimate evil or something. This system works out to be pretty neat, and would probably in today's gaming world be called the "Matching Cool Encounter System" or something crazy like that. As an early example, if you clear the air of toxins in one chapter, the characters in the other chapters will be amazed at how the sky suddenly turns blue and bright and clear. It really gives you a sense of three people doing stuff all at the same time. It seems like lots of developers now are using the "play-as-multiple-people" shtick nowadays, but not put to such good use.

The real jewel of the game though, at least to most people, is the game's magic system. It's all based on words; meaning, enscribe a word, any word you want, and pow it's a magic spell. There's some order to it all, like IG is a basic fire spell, and LEF is your healing magic, and you can attach various prefixes and suffixes to those words to make them more powerful or target multiple enemies and such. The further along you travel, the more powerful suffixes you can learn, and you can see what spells your enemies cast and try them out yourself. Pretty neat, huh? The problem is, the magic system the way it is, every single spell is available to you from the second you start playing; all you need to know is the right word. So you can go look at a FAQ or type in random things and immediately rock your enemies' faces, with no limit to your power other than your Max MP. It also seems like the developers were prepared for this, as the game (especially the bosses) are bastard hard. If you don't know what you're doing, you will die quickly and often. This might not be a problem if you know exactly what to do, but it seems like the game discourages fair play, while (in contradiction) encouraging straight-up trial-and-error. Personally, I've never been big on the whole "die repeatedly while learning from your mistakes" way of beating bosses.

Gideon Zhi mentions more than once that despite the graphical similarities, this game is definitely not Final Fantasy VI, in that you can't just walk through the game and expect to be prepared for anything. But is that necessarily a good thing?

Translation Description:

The 2.0 version polishes up and improves many things over the original release including a rewritten script, new VWF, polished intro hack, and more. Nice effort put forth by Gideon and AGTP. If you haven't played Rudra yet, this patch is surely recommended. Even if you have played it, it might be good for a second time through with this much improved patch!

Troddlers is a great puzzler in which the heroes run and jump around the screen, pushing boulders, picking up and moving blocks, in an effort to collect gems, guide your tiny allies to safety, and smash enemies.

Directions:

In many ways Troddlers is similar in style to Lemmings. Each level is one screen, and the objectives are laid out before the level begins. Push Up or A to Jump. Hold down B or X and push a direction to bring up a cursor over a block you want to move, then release the button to pick up the block.  

The same action can be used on an empty space to put a block there. Push boulders into position to climb on, or drop them to create gems. Dropping a boulder onto another boulder creates green gems, dropping it on ally Troddlers creates red, and dropping it on enemies creates blue. Later in the game new blocks are introduced, some of which explode when a Troddler steps on them, others made of ice which Troddlers can slip off of, and springs which can save Troddlers from a long fall. Also, of course, there is a time limit, what would a puzzler be without a time limit? But in this case, you can still see the screen while resting, so you can plan your strategy without wasting time.

There are two different 2-players modes in Troddlers. One is cooperative, in which both players work together to accomplish the goals of each level. The other is War, the two players trying to destroy one another's Troddlers, competing for gems, etc. 

Controls:

A Button - Jump
B Button - Grab or Drop Block
X Button - Not used
Y Button - Grab or Drop Block
Start Button - Accept Selection, Pause
Select Button - Accept Selection

Hints:

Jump-and-Pull

One of the most difficult, counter-intuitive techniques in the game, you must sometimes stand on a block, pick it up, and pull it up with you, without falling. This means mastering the timing so that you jump after the command to pick the block up, but before it disappears. With two blocks you can use this technique to climb all the way up the screen without touching any stable platforms.

"3D Golfing: 1992-Style!"

"True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links ", apart from being one of the longest-named games on the Super NES, is one of the few golf games ever released on this system. As far as I can find, there are only six or seven titles for the Super NES, (and I will get to reviewing those too). Just as this cart's title states, we are about to take on some of the most beautiful and revered eighteen-holes anywhere in the world: Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Pebble Beach, California (to be precise) is where the action takes place. And, after a fairly detailed title-screen featuring a digitised still from the 7th (I believe), ocean-view and all, we are taken to the title screen for some pre-round setup. The options are quite simple, and, no, you cannot play on any other course. Pebble Beach it is. You will get to know the course very well, as you can imagine. Next up, there is a strange choice of selecting initials for your character. There are no real-life golfers here, just a fairly well imaged generic man - but I'm talking generic here, (I couldn't even see any facial features).

What is strange however, is the seemingly very important choice players face next: your Caddie. A choice out of four very unusual looking caddies I must say. Don't think "Caddyshack", but more along the lines of a used-car salesman crossed with a sex-offender. One has the awful name of "Dawg", and a terrible handle-bar mustache to go along with it. Anyhow, after this selection, and a little "Good luck!" message-box, we're underway.

For an older game, the shot-mechanics are fairly flexible. Obviously, you adjust your aim by hitting a direction on the D-pad, (the screen then reloads the new image), and obviously, you can select your club, stance (curvature), and ball-striking position. You can see that the variables can add up to a decently adaptable swing and shot combo. There is however, little control over spin. As like most games from this genre, the swing-control itself is displayed as a circular power-meter that fills automatically - it is the players job to hit a button to stop this meter at the desired power-level. Get to greedy and you might over-shoot MAX-power only to hit a dribble-shot. That's right - the power meter cycles one-way only.

Graphically, this game is clear and quite colourful. Of course, the green wash of the course itself is the dominant colour, but the trees water and sand look good enough, although they are exceedingly simplified, (this game is not truly 3D-rendered). The animation of the swing is good enough, but nothing you haven't noticed enough before in other games. Another interesting feature that is quite uncommon in this genre is that if you hit up (or down), the point-of-view actually lifts into the air. This gives you a semi-fly-by perspective on the course, and you can notice that the "draw-distance", for lack of the actual term, is fairly distant and well-scaled.

Golf-fans would of liked this game when it was initially released. It is a fairly accurate simulation experience, although quite a nameless and faceless one. There is quite a bit to play around with on each shot, but it must be said that the insanely difficult putting display would test even the most seasoned golfers patience. Overall, the production values are good, but nothing fancy. The menus themselves are devoid of any character, but are eerily reminiscent of a Microsoft Windows 3.1 application, come to think of it.

There is not much reason to return to this game today, what with even the most simple hand-held games probably bettering it, but, for interested golf-sim fans, this is a nice trip into the past as it shows you just how things were done before EA conquered golf by signing up Woods.

True Golf: Wicked 18 (known in Japan as Devil's Course) is a Super NES and 3DO golfing game that takes place on the hardest simulated golf course in the world. The object is to guide the golf ball through nearly impossible obstacles as the player tries to score as low as possible in order to win the day. Using the caddy, it is possible to scan the situation before hitting the ball with an analyzer that is similar to RoboCop. This game shows players what the golf course in Hell will be like when they die. The bunkers are extremely treacherous, there is lava as well as water hazards, and out of bounds can be in the middle of the hole. There are no demons to battle as the player attempts to win in stroke play, match play, or tournament play (but just getting to the green can be dangerous).

There are also four caddies that help them. Each of them has its own personality and opinions about certain areas of each hole.

THE AWFUL TRUTH

Meet Harry Tasker. His wife and daughter think he's a slightly dull-witted computer salesman, but his friend and colleague Albert "Gig" Gibson knows the truth: Harry is a top agent for the Omega Sector, an ultra-secret government agency whose motto "The Last Line of Defense" spells out its mandate to prevent any terrorist threats to freedom!

Harry has the fate of a natio and the fight of a lifetime on his hands when the Crimson Jihad, a fanatic terrorist group led by the ruthless Abu Aziz, steals nuclear warheads from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan and threatens to detonate them on U.S. soil unless their demands are met!

Together with Gib, Harry must risk everything to prevent devastating destruction. The action is global as Harry's mission takes him from the snowy slopes of Switzerland to the Forbidden City of China, with deadly stops in the Florida Keys and a host of other locales that will prove unhealthy to the unwise. There's plenty of scenery, but it's no vacation.

Each mission is more menacing than the last, but each brings Harry closer to his goal - diffusing the warheads and disposing of Crimson Jihad hot heads! Harry is closing in on his sinister foe, but Aziz has one last trick up his sleeve - he makes it personal when he involves both Harry's wife, Helen, and their daughter, Dana. Big mistake! If Harry can rescue them from harm's way, payback is gonna be a hurtin' thing.

HIT IT, HARRY!

You are agent Harry Tasker, and it's up to you to thwart the destabilizing designs of Abu Aziz, before the Crimson Jihad rings down a nuclear nightmare! Your objective is to complete all the missions leading to the capture and destruction of the warheads, without destroying your happy home life!

From the Desk of the Secretary Department of the Navy

TO: Naval Aviators in the Mediterranean Area of Operations RE: Presidential Order #67

Recent events in your carrier group's area of operations have led to runaway political and military instability in the region. In order to stem the flow of military supplies and other stores into the area, the President has declared the air space surrounding this region closed to all military and civilian traffic. This is an attempt to ensure that the current situation does not deteriorate any further.

Naval aviators conducting operations in the so-called "No-Fly" Zone will be at a full state of combat readiness at all times. This air space is, in effect, a free-fire zone; any aircraft entering it will be assumed to have hostile intent. Naval aviators are authorized to neutralize any such threats using all of the means at their disposal.

Intelligence reports indicate that one of the nations in this region intends to test the President's resolve on this issue by conducting offensive air operations in spite of the ban on air traffic. Naval aviators are advised that the bulk of said nation's air power consists of aircraft produced in the former Soviet Union, chiefly top-of-the-line MiG-29s.

The President has expressed his confidence in the Navy's air arm to successfully maintain the peace in this volatile region. As for myself, I know that your training has prepared you for a mission such as this, and that you will execute your orders superbly.

_________________________
*
The game is a typical side scrolling shooter, going against the trend of other Capcom shooters, such as 1942, and 1943: The Battle of Midway, which are vertically scrolling shooters. However, like other Capcom shooters, the player has a life / energy bar that is consumed over the course of a single life as the player sustains damage. A trait highly uncommon among other comparable arcade style shooters which normally use a system of reserve lives, where one of which is lost upon a single enemy hit.

The player can choose between three mercenary pilots: Shin Kazama, Mickey Simon, and Greg Gates. Each pilot flies a specific plane and has slightly different capabilities.

Tips:

Gamer Mode
At the options menu, highlight Game Level with controller one and hold X and A on controller two.  Press Right twice on controller one. Exit the menu, and enjoy.

Some years after Lord British has returned to power, the Avatar is captured and tied on a sacrificial altar, about to be sacrificed by red demon-like creatures, the gargoyles. The Warriors of Destiny suddenly appear, save the Avatar and collect the sacred text the gargoyle priest was holding. In Castle Britannia, the Avatar learns that the shrines of Virtue were captured by the gargoyles and he embarks on a quest to rescue Britannia from the invaders.

Tips:

Oil Glitch
This glitch can be done at any time, but it works best if you have a fair amount of gold (about 300). From the Castle you start in, head south until you see the sundial, and follow the road eastwards. There are two buildings next to each other, Iolo's Bows (Run by his apprentice) and a smith to the left of Iolo's Bows. Go to the smith, and buy as much Oil as you can carry. Head to Iolo's bows to the right of the Smith and ask the apprentice about SELL. This will allow you to sell items. The Oil was 4 gold, but you can sell an Oil for 10 gold here, a glitch that allows a profit of 6 gold coins per oil you bought and sold.  You end up with more gold then you had before you bought the Oil.

At the dawning of the Age of Enlightenment, a movement called the Fellowship becomes the leading philosophical and moral ideology of the lands of Britannia. As the people embrace this new vision of a better world, they believe that disasters requiring the aid of the Avatar will be a thing of the past, and the Avatar himself and all his struggles will fade into legend. However, a mysterious figure known only as the Guardian threatens to force Britannia under his will, and the Avatar must once again return to the land, to find the source of these new disruptions.

THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE THAT IS NOT POWER...

"You have been chosen to represent Earth in Mortal Kombat. Be warned. For although your souls are safe from Shao Kahn's evil: your lives are not. I can no longer interfere, as your Earth is now ruled by the Outworld gods."

...These are the words of Rayden

The Shaolin Tournament for Martial Arts, better known as Mortal Kombat was, for countless ages, a noble institution that tested the metal of the very best Warriors. Years ago, the Tournament was corrupted by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung who dared to take not only the lives of his opponents, but their very souls. Eventually, it became known that Shang Tsung was acting at the behest of his diabolical master Shao Kahn, Emperor of the Outworld, who planned to claim all the souls on earth. The Champions of Earth: Liu Kang, Kung Lao, their Ancestors and others have, so far, thwarted this plan. For centuries Earth has used Mortal Kombat to defend itself against the Outworld's Emperor, Shao Kahn.

Frustrated by failed attempts to take Earth through Tournament battle, Kahn enacts a plan which began 10,000 years ago. During that time Shao Kahn had a Queen named Sindel and her early death was unexpected. Kahn's Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, made it possible for Sindel's spirit to someday be reborn: not on the Outworld, but on the Earth Realm itself.

This evil act gives Shao Kahn the power to step through the dimensional gates and reclaim his Queen, thus enabling him to finally seize the Earth Realm.

Upon breaching the portal into Earth, Shao Kahn slowly transforms the planet into a part of the Outworld. He strips the Earth of all human life-claiming every soul as his own. But there are souls which Kahn cannot take. These souls belong to the Warriors chosen to represent Earth in a new Mortal Kombat. The remaining humans are scattered throughout the planet. Shao Kahn sends an army of fierce Outworld Warriors to find and eliminate them. Some of Earth's Warriors survive the attacks. Most do not. The remaining few hold the one chance at saving all of human kind.

--From the SNES Mortal Kombat 3: Ultimate instruction manual.

Overview:

Gameplay was identical to MK3 but introduced a few new elements. Two new tournament modes were introduced. One was entitled 2-on-2 Kombat Mode which was similar to an Endurance match but with human players on both sides. There was also a new eight player tournament mode. "Chain combos" could be started by using a jump punch (vertical or angled) or a vertical jump kick which created more comboing opportunities. Some characters were given extra combos and some combos were even damage reduced. Combos that knock opponents in the air would no longer send one's opponent to the level above in multi layered levels. Only regular uppercuts would allow for this. New MK3 characters are added in UMK3 including Kitana, Jade, Reptile and Scorpion.

Some characters were given new moves. Stryker now has a "Riot Gun" special move. Kano's cannonball move could be performed in two ways; one would make Kano move straight ahead like in MK3 and the other moved diagonally. Liu Kang and Sonya have new combos which can knock opponents in the air, leading to more combo possibilities.

I can clearly say, without any doubt, that this is the greatest game ever. To hell with MGS, move over SotN, Umihara Kawase is the game of choice for me, thank you very much. And why, you ask? Because you're a girl with a fishing line for a weapon, that's why! All the enemies are fish, and you have to hook on to them and reel them in! Pretty cool eh? Well the coolest part is that your fishing line is also used as a grappling hook. So you can swing around and do all kinds of fun crazy things. Of course, this makes for some pretty endless replay value. It's even fun to die, for reasons that just can not be explained. I always laugh maniacally when she dies, because it's just so much FUN, and it makes this hilarious "sploosh" sound when she falls in the water! Of course it kind of sucks when you've wasted all your lives goofing around. So, for the benefit of our loyal visitors, here is a ZSNES CHT file I made, which allows for infinite lives. Now you can screw around all you want!

Translation Description:

Well the only thing that was in Japanese was the Replay menus, so those are all translated and happy. So things are groovy, and all is happy. Yep.

Tips:

Hard Mode
On the title screen, press the Select button exactly 100 times. A 5 minute time limit appear in green text next to the start option. If you press Select again, the green text will disappear.

Code: Press Select 100 times, then Start. 
Effect: Five minute time limit.

Uncharted Waters
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Koei
Publisher: Koei
_________________________
*
Uncharted Waters is a popular Japanese video game series produced by Koei. In East Asia, the series has a large cult following, but has not received much recognition outside East Asia. The series has been compared to Sid Meier's Pirates! in gameplay and theme. It is a simulation and CRPG series dealing with sailing and trading.

In the games, the player takes up the role of a captain and manages a seagoing fleet to participate in trades, privateering, treasure hunting, exploration, and plain piracy. Even though the series is largely open-ended, there is still a loose plot which requires the player to follow certain paths, and deviating from these paths may stall the progress of the story.

Known as Daikoukai Jidai II in Japan, this game is perhaps the most famous of the series. Even though an English version exists, it still has not managed to achieve the mainstream popularity Pirates! had. There is only a relatively small following outside of East Asia.

In this game, there are six protagonists to choose from, each of them representing a different path or career featured in the game.  While the game is more or less open-ended, developing the character's career is necessary to advance the plot.

Uniracers
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Racing
Release Year: 1994
Developer: DMA Design
Publisher: Nintendo
_________________________
*
The Sun didn't rise, the Moon didn't set. Fluffy clouds failed to make any sort of appearance and the night wasn't dark and stormy. Nobody was silhouetted against a backdrop of stars and the burning fires of the dawn sky somehow never had a chance. There were no such things, you see. Not in the Universe of the Uniracers.

But heck, that's the way it goes sometimes. There were far more important things to work up a sweat about than some pretty scenery. Racing for one thing, for another....well that was it, just racing. It was the whole purpose of the Uniracers. And it happened sort of like this:

Far in the past, or what passed for the past, some great and powerful person looked across the abstract Universe and realized that his boredom went right off the scale. He was through with creating a planet here, an asteroid there. What's more he was trying to impress a young goddess who thought that he lacked a creative imagination. After all, you can only say kind things about a newly created world so many times without giggling.

This wasn't a fun situation for the person, as you can well imagine. So after a timeless interval locked in the celestial equivalent of a cupboard, with an endless supply of Turbo-Strength Coffee, he came up with the idea of a race of Unicycles who would compete in the ultimate games! What's more, it would really break the ice at parties.

Such is the legend told by Unicycles when they slow down enough to talk to each other (well sometimes), although no-one

seems to know whether the Person actually won over the young goddess and lived happily ever after. In fact if you stopped a Unicycle and asked, you'd find that none of them really cared. It's RACING that's the thing.

So the Uniracers came into being and, boy, were they racing machines or what?!?! An entire race of dedicated cycles. Sure enough they got right into their role and raced all the time in the abstract days and neon nights of their Universe. And so it went for a long, long time.

But there is something else, too. Even when a Unicycle couldn't find a racing partner, out of the abstract blue would turn up a Ghostly cycle to provide a race by which to measure themselves. The Ghosts never talk, never hang about to see what happens. Some call them the free spirits of cycles that lost important races and were condemned to race forever to prove themselves. Others claim that they are the personal cycles of that old Person, used to make sure the rest of them keep on track.

And at the very end of the "day" in whispers, is told the tale of the Anti-Uni, the ultimate racer whom no-one can find, no-one but the very greatest of all. Become the very height of racing excellence and the Anti-Uni will come to challenge you...

--From the SNES Uniracers instruction manual.

Overview:

Uniracers is a simple, but fast paced game that is a lot of fun. Race unicycles in a large series of tracks, and do different stunts to boost your speed and your ego! Either race head to head, or gain points by performing stunts in special stunt tracks. Play against the computer or go at it split screen with a friend. Either way you'll have a good time.

Directions:

This game is forunately not too hard to figure out, even if you have never played it before. There are a series of tours and a series of races or stunt courses in each tour. Grab a cycle, pick a tour and track and then your ready.

Progress by successfully completing all tracks in a tour.

Accelerate by pressing the control pad left or right (depending on which direction you want to go). Press B to jump and Y to brake. Perform different stunts by getting a lot of air (i.e. jumping from high places) and using the X, Y, R, and L buttons. Perform different stunt combinations to get more points and gain more speed. But be sure to land with your wheel to the ground or performing the stunt will hurt more than it will help.

Controls:

A Button - Twist Stunt
B Button - Jump
X Button - Z-flip Stunt
Y Button - Brake
L Button - Flip Left (Stunt)
R Button - Flip Right (Stunt)
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Scroll Down Main Menu

Hints:

Head Start
To get gain some speed when starting up, jump and do a single flip the direction you are going, even if you are just on a flat surface. Use this same trick to gain speed on straight-a-ways.

Genre: Movie Adaption

_________________________

Universal Soldier was in development by a company called Carolco and was to be published by Accolade. The game was actually a sequel to the Manfred Trentz game, Turrican, but the character sprite was changed so that it could be rebranded as a movie tie-in. A rom of what appears to be the complete version of this game exists. The enemies and gameplay closely match Turrican, as to be expected. It is unknown why this game was canceled. Genesis and Game Boy versions of this game were released, and Turrican 2 was released on various computer platforms. Nintendo Power commented in the October 1992 issue that it was similar to Contra, but complained about the poor controls.

Untitled NFL Football Game
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (USA)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Sports , Football
_________________________
*
This football game is presumably developed by Sculptured Software using the same rotoscope Mode 7 engine that is used in games such as NHL Stanley Cup, NCAA Basketball, and Tony Meola's Sidekick Soccer. The presence of the Arizona Cardinals, L.A. Raiders and L.A. Rams indicates that this game was in development for the 1994 season. There in no apparent use of real player names, so perhaps there was no plans to have a NFLPA liscense (similar to NHL Stanley Cup). 

Aside from the game, which I would say it pretty much complete, there was a lot of issues with the menu system. You had to manually select that it was a single player match, and it seems that you cannot chose which of the two teams you pick to play as. Also, when you go to the play menu, it defaults to "pass game", so that it just simulates the outcome. Blah.

On the whole, I thought that this untitled NFL Football game would actually be a pretty decent sports game for the snes. There wasn't much of a frame rate issue, which plagued many EA games. It was also a hell of a lot more balanced than NHL Stanley Cup. One can only guess as to why this wasn't released, but I imagine intense competition at the time had something to do with it.

Another helicopter shoot-em-up in the Desert Strike tradition. This time, the evil psycho villain is a Presidential hopeful who lost his grip on reality when he lost the election. Urban Strike takes you to various destinations around the United States, following his movements and foiling his schemes to cripple our civilization.

Utopia: The Creation of a Nation
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Strategy
Release Year: 1993
Developer: Gremlin Graphics Software
Publisher: Jaleco
Players: 1
_________________________
*
Populous meets SimCity... in Outer Space. Your mission is to build a thriving colony on a foreign planet, while wiping out the alien resistance.

A pioneer of Real Time Strategy gaming, Utopia is a truly fun and addictive game. The graphics are awesome, the music is great, and most of the sound effects are really cool, except for a few that can be a bit annoying. And since each mission is different, the replay value is very high as well.

Directions:

The controls for Utopia take some getting used to, as usual, but hey, what do you want, it's a strategy game. 

Buildings are the heart and soul of Utopia. Go to the Hard Hat icon to check out the buildings available to you. New types of building will become available as your technology increases. For most of the buildings it's pretty obvious what they do. The Store should have been named Storage because it holds stuff and doesn't make money. Flux Pods store energy and allow you to build nearby (you need to build them to expand your territory). Hospitals allow you to set the Birth Rate of your colony by using Query Mode (question mark icon). You probably want it on High most of the time. Mines and Chemical Plants produce ore and fuel, respectively, from underground deposits. To find deposits check the Maps screen (globe icon) and press A to cycle through the different views. The Arms Lab is not a separate research center for military technology, it's just the place where guns are made for your tanks and ships. All research is done in Laboratories.

Military buildings: Utopia gives you several choices in attack and defence, the main distinction being Air and Ground. Turrets and missile launchers work automatically, missiles being the most effective air defense. Tank shops constantly build the best available tanks, as long as you have plenty of Ore, Weapons, and Power, and room near the shop for the tank to appear. Ship Yards must be built next to a Launch Pad, which must be next to a Fuel Tank to fuel your ships. These are air ships, by the way, not boats. You must tell the shop which ship to build, and they build one at a time. Also if the launch pad is full no more ships will be made.

Moving Units: Units can be given orders by double-clicking the L button. Tanks can be moved in mass, to any of the 8 Markers (you can put these where you want by pressing Y in Query Mode) or to the Alien City. Interestingly, the Alien City is not on the map, it is located somewhere else. You only see the aliens if they attack you. Planes must be given orders individually. They can be told to go to any of the markers and either Land or Hover once they get there, or they can be ordered to attack the Alien City. Pay attention to your spy reports to know whether to attack with tanks or ships.

Money Management (Dollar Icon): Always Always ALWAYS put money into research (both civilian and military) and spying. Research grants will be used gradually as your scientists work, and of course you have to have labs for them to work in. Spying grants will be used as spy reports come in. Check spy reports by clicking the Magnifying Glass icon. Research breakthroughs will be reported as they occur, and you will be notified when a spy report comes in as well. Go to the little x at the bottom to see the next page of the financial report. It tells you how many men are employed in various industries, and how much they are producing. If they aren't producing, you need more Power or raw materials. the nest page is the Trading screen. You can only trade once per month, and only if there is a supply or demand for the goods you want to buy or sell. Tech is another item that has been badly named. It stands for luxury goods produced by you Workshops.

Council (Face icon): These guys will tell you what you're doing and what you're doing wrong, and sometimes what you need to do to make it right. Listen to them. 

Controls:

A Button - Build, Bulldoze, Help
B Button - Cancel, Toggle between Tool Bar and Map
X Button - Toggle between Build, Bulldoze and Query Modes, Change Taxes or Grants
Y Button - Change Taxes or Grants, Move Marker
L Button - Select Units (click twice)
Start Button - Start Game

Hints:

Ship Yards
Ships take a lot longer to build than tanks, so you'll need more ship yards than tank shops. Fortunately, you can put more than one by each launch pad, just make sure they each have their own corner.

Security!
The Council will never tell you you need more Security stations, but it is vital that you build them near living quarters and military shops. Otherwise disgruntled citizens will steal money from the colony's coffers and sabotage your tanks and planes. Bad News!

Buy Low, Sell High
This advice applies of course to the trade screen. Most things you won't want to buy unless you need them, you'll just be selling extras that you made. However, Gems have a dramatic fluctuation in price, so you can buy them up for cheap (40-50) and sell them off for lots (80-100+). So if you have extra storage and the opportunity comes, buy cheap gems!

This game is a lot of fun if you like casino games. It has roulette, craps, poker, blackjack, and slots. The graphics are well drawn and have very authentic color schemes. A lot of the graphics are still, so they have a lot more detail. The controls are easy because the game gives you a diagram at the beginning, and it's a point and click system. The gameplay is good because it has five different games, and there is attention to detail that gives the game a sense of realism. If you like casino games, be sure to give this one a try.

Directions:

Choose adventure, or multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you will play with a friend and see who can win the most money. In adventure mode, you will try to win as much money as you can in the first casino so you can become a high roller and move on to the no limit casino. In the no limit casino, your goal will be ten million dollars. When you reach that, you will have beaten the game. In both casinos they have roulette, poker (seven card stud), blackjack, slots, and craps. At any point during the game, you can press select to bring up the menu and go back to your room. When you go to your room, the game will give you a password for continuing your game later. You can also switch games from this menu.

Controls:

A Button: Select
B Button: Cancel
X Button: None
Y Button: None
Start Button: Start/Pause
Select Button: Select/Menu

Hints:

Know when to fold 'em

When playing poker, you may get down to a low chip count. When you are in this position, be sure to look at your first three cards and if they are worth it, just go all in, and if they aren't, fold.

This game is an adaptation of a popular anime series of the same name. Unfortunately, neither the anime nor the Nes or Snes games have seen a release in the US. So, I must thank Taskforce & Co. for this excellent translation.

The game itself is standard RPG fare: five heroes are set off to save the world, interspersed with anime cut scenes and random monster encounters. Of course, if you're anything like me (chances are you're not), you'll love this game. It's fun ^_^. If you're a fan of the "old-school" RPG, you'll love this game, download the patch now!

The readme doesn't mention it, but this patch needs a ROM with a header to work.

Oh my god, this game rules. Despite the fact that Hamel looks? shall we say? less than intimidating when he plays his violin at enemies, this game rules. It plays sorta like what would happen if Ys 3 and Milon's Secret Castle got drunk one night and? well, you get the picture. You play as this violinist guy who goes around playing music a lot. And you get this tag-along girl named Flute who you can chuck at enemies. But that's not all! If you collect costumes, she can morph into nifty other weird creature things that usually look rather demented, and she's invincible and has special powers. But she also tends to go off and do her own thing, and disappears RIGHT when you need her. So the costumes can be a bad thing too. But the game rules nonetheless. GO PLAY. NOW.

A long time ago, the evil king, Mao, armed with seemingly unlimited power, attacked your country. The poor people were scared, but stood strong against his advances. The people came together against King Mao and defeated him in a flash of brilliance. No one was sure if Mao was truly dead, and the all feared his return...

FEATURES:

LMB: Linear Motion Battle System

This new battle system allows for the speed and action not present in many turn based RPG battle systems. You control the main charachter, Cless, but you can also give orders to your other characters allowing the computer's sophisticated AI to control them. Both length and height are included, allowing for many levels of attack. 

FVD: Flexible Voice Driver

Usually, the Super FamCom's sound hardware would not be able to handle playing full voice samples. However, with the Flexible Voice Driver, you can include even full songs, like the opening theme "The Dream Will Not Die". All the attacks and spells are fully voiced, but you can control how much voice you hear from the game. Many talented voice actors and actresses lent their talents for this marvelous game.

The year is 2410.  Scientists have developed the perfect soldier through genetic engineering. Three groups of soldiers meant to protect humanity have revolted against their masters. As a result, four factions are fighting it out for control of the Earth. Each side has infantry, tanks, and the air force needed to get the job done. The player is in command of the GDA (Global Defense Alliance) and the primary objective for the game's 20 missions is total annihilation against M.A.R.S. (a group of unsavory superhumans who have turned against their masters), the Orcs, and the Cromes (An Army of Self-Sentient, Self-Aware Combat Robots). Capturing a lab results in the ability to build a super weapon to destroy the other factions.

This war would decide the fate of humanity and set the stage clear for its sequel War 3010: The Revolution.

Players can play in exhibition mode, regular season mode, playoff mode, and even listen to stereotypical music of each nation in the sound test mode (country music for Canada, rock and roll music for Team USA, for example). In the Sega version, the player's names are formalized (Thomas instead of Tom, David instead of Dave, Steven instead of Steve, etc.).

Players can also have the CPU play some or all of their regular season, but the computer will lose more games than win them so it's important to play as many games as possible manually. In addition to NHL teams, the player can also play as international teams(Sweden, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Russia, United States and Canada).

It's 10:30pm Friday night. What's it time for? Exsqueeze me? Baking powder? Did you say Hawaii Five-O reruns. I think NOT. In Aurora Illinois, it's time for Cable Access Channel Ten and Wayne's World. I'm your excellent host Wayne Campbell, and with me as always is Garth. It's Wayne's World. It's Wayne's World. It's Party Time. It's Excellent. Woo Woo Woo Woo Woo. Okay.

You'll Laugh, You'll Cry, You'll Hurl!

Are you ready for this? Number One of the Top Ten Most Bizarre Things to Happen This Year: Garth has been kidnapped! No WAY, you say? Hway!! It all begins down at Noah's Arcade, where Wayne & Garth are engrossed (with a capital G) in a most heinous game called Zantar. All of a sudden there's a blinding flash, and Ka-Boom! The two find themselves inside the game! IN the wink of an eye, the hapless Garth is inhaled by Zantar, the gelatinous cube - a pixelated purple putridosity of the first degree! Before our stunned hero can react, Zantar is gone... and Garth along with him. And no you, Wayne Campbell, must heartily rescue your excellent sidekick from a fate most unbecoming!

But as you make your way through your familiar and beloved hangouts in search of Garth, you'll notice something disturbingly different. This world is twisted, warped, and distorted version of reality as you know it! Armed with your mighty guitar and the power the SCHWING, you must brave the surrealistic perils of Kramer's Music Store, Stan Mikita's Donut Shop, the Gasworks night club, and surburbia. There, you will spar with such Dweeboids as monster bagpipes, accordions, and kazoos (shyeah, rright!), spewing coffee cups and dangerous Disco balls (as if!), hair-whipping headbangers and a strange Psycho Hose Beast (way!)

HELLO? Are you worthy to face this mega-challenge without Blowing Chunks? Then party on, my friend, to the most excellent finish!

_________________________

Shopper's Bazaar was one of the first gameshows ever to get it's name dissed right off the face of the earth - and get it's next name - Wheel of Fortune.

So a little history for you there. The original Wheel of Fortune was called Shopper's Bazaar, and it looked nothing like it does in this video game. Well, enough about history - here's the game. Now the whole idea behind Wheel of Fortune is winning cash and merchandise by solving puzzles and spinning a big wheel.

Now in fair comparison to the 1992 version of Wheel of Fortune, this one is much worse. The only few additions is a sadder looking puzzle board, new avatars, Vanna looking much worse than in the last game, a new look of the wheel, and a few more things I can't remember. But you will get 2 extra rounds of play (a 4th round and a speed-up round, in which Vanna spins the wheel and whatever she lands on is the main cash value for the round). The same voice from Vanna and her lovely mug shot in the intro. Wanna see that mug shot? Hit "Play Now."

Directions:

The object of Wheel of Fortune is to solve puzzles by spinning a wheel and guessing letters in the puzzle. The wheel holds several dollar values, including the dreaded Bankrupt and Lose-a-Turn. But it also has insane dollar amounts such as $1,000, $2,500, $3,500, and the more than fine $5,000, and that lovely green space called "Free Spin". The person who has the most money at the end of the game wins and goes on to the bonus round. It doesn't matter if they win that or not.

Controls:

A Button - Solve puzzle
B Button - Buy Vowel
X Button - Select letters
Y Button - Spin Wheel
Start Button - Start game from main menu
Select Button - Pick new puzzle

Hints:

How to make sweet bucks.

Lets say you've run into a nice puzzle, and you know the answer. now take this approach - if you hit a low amount number, don't pick a letter that has lots of spaces in the puzzle, and don't pick a low profile letter on a high dollar amount.

It's the hit game-show that's been on several TV channels since 1975, it's America's game; WHEEL....OF....FORTUNE!

If you don't know about the great game-show Wheel of Fortune, I'd say you were born before the primitive life began. So if you haven't seen the game-show, do so. Once you've seen it, come back and hit the "Play Now" button. Trust me, you'll want to see the game-show before you come back and play this.

Directions:

Wheel of Fortune is divided into rounds. Each round, there's a puzzle. Characters take turns spinning the wheel and choosing letters to solve the puzzle and win money and prizes. Prizes include trips, cars, jewelry and money. However, there are things on the wheel that can cause your money boat to sink: the lose-a-turn, and the dreaded bankrupt. The person with the most money after the game wins and plays a bonus round. The bonus round gives you the letters R,S,T,L,N,E and 3 consonants and one vowel of your choice.

THE CHASE IS ON...

Monday, 5 a.m. A ringing sound jars you awake. You grope the phone and drop the receiver on the floor. Out of the darkness comes the voice of the chief: "Wake up, kid. Got an assignment for you."

You stumble out of bed, turn on the light and grab your brand new detective's notebook.

"Just got a call from Interpol," says the chief. "Looks like Carmen's gang has pulled another caper." "Any leads?" you ask. "Not with this bunch. They're too slick. Can't give you any more details on the phone. Better get down to the office double quick. It's going to be a rough one."

"Right chief."

As your trembling hand replaces the phone on the cradle, you wonder why you ever got into this line pf work. Before this morning, Carmen Sandiego and her Villains' International League of Evil (V.I.L.E.) were just sensational headlines in the newspaper. For more than five years, Carmen and her gang of felons had managed to stockpile the world's most valuable treasures while outwitting every so-called crime expert from New York to Sydney. Now they've struck again. And you, the newest employee of the Acme Detective Agency, Have been given the near-impossible assignment of tracking them down.

--from the SNES Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? instruction manual


The goal of the game is to track Carmen's villains around the world, arrest them and ultimately arrest Carmen herself. The player begins the game by first going to the country where the crime took place and then obtaining hints from various sources on where the thief went next, leading to a chase around the world to find the thief before "time" runs out.

Each case begins with the user being alerted that a spectacular theft has been committed. Starting by first traveling to the scene of the crime, the player is given several opportunities to collect clues about the suspect's next location, which come in the form of pun-filled word play about the target place. There are thirty countries that can be visited in the game and each is identified by the name of a prominent city, though this city is not always consistent with the image of the country shown in the game. For example, Lima is given for Peru, but the game instead shows an image of Machu Picchu.

If the player travels to an incorrect location, they receive nonsensical clues and will have to backtrack to the previous location to try again. If the player travels to the correct location, a simple animation of an obvious but otherwise harmless V.I.L.E. henchman lurking across the screen is played. The gameplay continues to repeat in this manner as the player travels from location to location several times before catching up to the criminal.

The case will be lost if the user "runs out of time". Throughout the game, the time is shown as the hour accompanied by the day of the week and every action taken in the game (questioning a witness, traveling to another location, etc.) causes a few hours to progresses. At the start of the game a "deadline" is given by which point the crook must be arrested and, if that time is passed, the case is lost and the crook escapes. The times given in the game do not take changes of time zones into account.


The Warrant and the Arrest:

The player will occasionally be given information on the suspect, which is used to obtain a warrant on them so as to narrow down the suspect to one of the V.I.L.E. members in the database. Once the player reaches the final location, the animation of the nearby V.I.L.E. henchman becomes more aggressive and implies imminent danger and any clues the player receive simply suggest that they should watch their back. Investigating further clues lead to a chase scene and the apprehending of the suspect, which is always automatically successful. However, the mission is only successful if the appropriate warrant was issued. Having an incorrect warrant or no warrant at all causes the criminal to be found innocent in court, therefore causing the whole mission to have been wasted.

Each successful mission is noted in the player's record and they will occasionally go up in rank. Before being promoted, the user had to correctly answer a geography question with the help of a reference book that was included with the program. This was included as a form of protection against disk copying. Each rank gives harder assignments with more locations to travel to before arriving at the final one. In the final case, the culprit is Carmen Sandiego herself and apprehending her lands the player in the hall of fame.

Solve the Greatest Crimes of All Times

Carmen Sandiego, notorious ringleader of Villains International League of Evil, has confiscated a time machine and is swiping history's priceless treasures. It's up to you to catch her before she alters the course of history. 7 Challenging levels Hundreds of cases

Accurate and detailed cultural background FEATURES: the Chronoskimmer 325i, an advanced time travel machine that allows you to voyage into centuries past.

--From the SNES Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego? instruction manual.

This version is a multiplatform video game where players have to travel through time to collect the clue and the warrant necessary to capture Carmen Sandiego or one of her henchmen. Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego, a game show which was formerly broadcast on PBS, was loosely based on this game.

The goal of this game is to track Carmen's villains through history and arrest them and ultimately arrest Carmen herself. Similar to the original Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, the player has to use the clues given to them on where the crook went to, and physical attributes or interests of the crook in order to secure an arrest warrant.

This was the first game in the series to establish that ACME Headquarters is located in San Francisco, California.

A platformer title starring Valkyrie's lizard friend Xandra. In the game, which plays as a prequel of the Valkyrie games, you control Xandra as he leaves his enchanted forest in order to get help for his family. This will eventually lead him to meet up with our beloved Valkyrie and mark the beginning of their adventures.

Xandra has all the abilities of a standard platformer character, which allow him to jump around and navigate the many obstacles found in the game. Additionally he's armed with a pitchfork which he can use to impale his enemies and stick to some surfaces. Collecting coins allow him to purchase extra lives, but there are no added weapons or spells as in the Valkyrie games.

Release Year: 1996
Developer: Flair Software

_________________________

Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren't always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you'd logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy this reduces the significance of the points system.

The game's setting is that of the Wild West but various science fiction elements are present; most notably robots, who serve as most of the bosses in the game. This mixture is a prime example of the Steampunk genre.

The objective is to seek revenge against a murderous gang that killed the family member of one of the playable characters. The female character, Annie, has searched down a bounty hunter by the name of Clint to help her get revenge and to rescue the few family members she has left. The player or players navigate through several different levels fighting everything from towering machines to armored trains. 

Gameplay:

The game employs a third-person, fixed viewpoint and is primarily about shooting, similar to Cabal. The player controls the movement of both the on-screen character and the targeting reticule with the diagonal buttons. While shooting, the character stands still. Various maneuvers, such as jumping, double jumping and dodge-rolls are possible. Beyond the standard gun several other weapons are obtainable, such as a gatling gun, shotgun, or a grenade launcher though these hold only limited ammunition. As is common in shooter games, the player has access to a number of screen-clearing bombs.

"Snakes! Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?"

The nest of deadly snakes has been disturbed by seismic experiments in a remote location. Now the snakes are slithering to the surface, causing confused terror in attacks on everything that crosses their path.

There is a way to control this madness, but it's not going to be easy. The snakes from this nest tend to eat snakes of the same color and design. If you can guide the slithering masses so that snakes of the same type meet and eliminate each other, then the world could be saved from this snake infestation.

It's all up to you! Guide the snakes, find matching pairs and keep the population under control!

Wile E Coyote's Revenge
Platform: Super NES
Region: Prototype (USA)
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Strategy
_________________________
*
Road Runner's Death Valley Rally was an awkward platform game. The logical step for the sequel would be to have you control Wile E. Coyote as he pursued the Road Runner. The development duties went to Software Creations, who created games like Plok and Blaster Master 2 for the Genesis. The game is sort of a 2.5D game, where Wile E Coyote can move up and down to take different paths.

A rom exists of an early version of the game, though it appears to be in more primitive form.

The first level seems pretty much complete. To complete the level, you chase after the Road Runner and break open various boxes. There are various traps that are straight from the cartoon, such as the infamous rubber band trick. Unfortunately, the game crashes after the first level in the rom. 

The graphics are simple, though it is pretty faithful to the style of the cartoons. In the rom, the sound effects were pretty standard fare, and the music was extremely muted. The play control was down pat, though. I'm sure if this game were finished, it would have been one of the better licenced platform games in the snes era.

Rene Boutin, producer of this game gives a synopsis of development and overview of the game:

The high level concept of the game was that the player got to be "the bad guy" (Coyote) for once. You'd speed through a level collecting parts to a contraption, and meanwhile being antagonized by the Road Runner. Then the next level, you'd have your contraption built and you'd be using it.

Now Warner Bros would NEVER allow Coyote to actually catch RR, so in the game every time you got within a few pixels of RR, he takes off. I think once players would catch on to the futility of trying to chase RR, they'd probably ignore him altogether. And this was one of the big flaws in the overall design of the game (Which I readily admit to having had a big responsibility in}. 

The other angle to the gameplay was for a game with lots of fast running along really long levels. A kind of fervent fast racing type of gameplay with SOME elements of platformers. But that just wasn't panning out by this stage in the project. Something was seriously lacking. In hindsight we could have had a sort of meter that the player would have to keep full by staying real close to the Road Runner as much as possible, while hunting for the parts to his contraption. But instead, the best we could come up with at the time was good old "collecting stuff" (bleah!). Trying to co-design a game with a team that was half-way across the globe didn't help either. Ideally a designer needs to be working hand in hand with a programmer. Ah what a decade+ of wisdom and game experience can do, huh?

Last info I want to share with you is the reasons for the cancellation. Although I've conveyed here that the game lacked depth by that point, the big event was Sunsoft's closure for bankruptcy.

Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Compilation , Arcade
Release Year: 1996
Developer: Digital Eclipse Software
Publisher: Midway
_________________________
*
This is one of the compilations that game companies occasionally come up with. The games are as follows:

Defender: In this side-scrolling space shooter, you have to defeat all the enemies to continue to the next level.

Defender II: The sequel to Defender. In addition to all the features in the original, you can warp to the other side of the planet.

Joust: Knock all the enemies off the vultures and collect the eggs.

Robotron: 2084: Shoot the robots with your laser to proceed to the next level. Remember, the last human family's fate is in your hands.

Sinistar: Your goal in this game is to mine Sinibombs from asteroids and defeat Sinistar (the big white guy floating around). Also beware of the little aliens waiting to attack you.

I like the fact that Williams ported these games to SNES, but I don't get to see the attract screens. I would rather play the games in their Shockwave versions and in Midway Arcade Treasures (PS2, Xbox, GCN) than play ports that don't have the feel of the original.

I will list the controls for the games in the order that they're presented in the main menu.

Directions:

Relive the moments of your favorite arcade hits from the '80s. 

Controls:

A Button - Nothing, Inviso, Flap, Fire Right, Nothing
B Button - Hyperspace, Hyperspace, Flap, Fire Down, Nothing
X Button - Bomb, Bomb, Flap, Fire Up, Sinibomb
Y Button - Fire, Fire, Flap, Fire Left, Fire
L Button - Switch Direction, Switch Direction, Flap, Nothing, Nothing
R Button - Move, Move, Flap, Nothing, Hide Status Bar
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Nothing, Nothing, Nothing, Auto-Fire, Slow Motion

Hints:

255 Lives
This will only happen if Sinistar sucks you in on your last life and a UFO appears during this action. A -1 will appear in your lives.

In The Distant Future, Mankind Is Locked In A Deadly War...

2629 A.D. Terran Confederation exploration ship, Iason, penetrates the Vega Sector and encounters a spacecraft of unknown origin. Iason Commander, Jedora Andropolous, beams the greeting designed by Earth's Committee for Interaction with Alien Intelligences. The alien vessel opens up with all guns, destroying the Iason and all hands.

2634 A.D. The Terran Confederation declares war on the Empire of Kilrah in the Vega Sector. The Kilrathi, a vicious catlike race, retaliate with a punitive strike against the human colony on McAuliffe. After days of intense combat, the Kilrathi spearhead is momentarily broken.

2639 A.D. Kilrathi forces occupy and enslave the human world of Enyo. In Phase I of the Enyo Engagement, a small human attack force drops space mines and engages enemy ships. As the Kilrathi escape the mined region, they belatedly realize that it is the jump point for Phase II of the attack. The Enyo Engagement ends with the Kilrathi forced into retreat.

2649 A.D. Terran ground forces launch an attack on a Kilrathi colonial fortification, but are routed by unexpected Kilrathi fighter-craft support. TCS Tiger's Claw fights a delaying action to give the Terran fleet time to reach safety. The Tiger's Claw is able to jump back into Terran space with most of its engines destroyed and half its pilots listed as casualties. The carrier spends six months in space dock, being repaired and refitted.

Today You are a rookie pilot on the refurbished Tiger's Claw. You will learn your mission objectives for attacking and fighting the Kilrathi in secret briefings onboard the mother ship.

--From the SNES Wing Commander instruction manual.

Directions:

"The game begins on your mother ship, the TCS Tiger's Claw. Onboard, you move from room to room to learn about your comrades-in-arms and your combat mission. Once you know your flight mission, you're off to fight the Kilrathi.

If you fail, the dreaded Kilrathi will prevail as overlords on all human worlds. So get out there and kick some tail!" (This paragraph can be found in the instruction booklet)

The basis of how this game works is that you complete a series of missions by clearing checkpoints, escorting other ships, overcoming obstacles, and more. This can be a challenging task, especially since enemies ships can surround you at any time. There are a lot of controls in this game which can be kind of confusing, but once you get used it you'll find that this game can be quite fun. Please take note at all the controls listed below, because there are a lot of actions that require multiple buttons to perform. 

Controls:

A Button - Fire special weapon
B Button - Fire normal gun
X Button - View navigation map (will not work if navigation system is damaged)
Y Button - Afterburner
L Button - Decrease speed
R Button - Increase speed
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Use with other button to perform a specific action (see below)
L + R buttons - Reduce speed to 0
Select + A Button - Cycle to next available weapon
Select + B Button - Cycle to next available gun type
Select + X Button - Select target to lock on to. (Press X again to lock on, only works in targeting mode.)
Select + Y Button - Engage autopilot (when no enemies/obstacles around)
Select + L Button - Switch between weapons and damage display
Select + R Button - Select navigation, targeting, or communications systems.
L + R + Select + Start Eject

Hints:

Dodging enemies
If you are being attacked, use the afterburner and fly all around (not straight) to avoid them. Then try to get the enemy in your view by using your radar so you can attack back.

Get partner to break and attack
When you're in range of enemies, quickly press select + R until you get to communications then tell your partner to break and attack by pushing x (or press select + x to cycle through other commands).

Wings II:Aces High is a very entertaining game. It's a lot like Pilotwings except it has a WWI theme. There are a ton of missions to complete, and several pilots to choose from. As you go through the game, your pilots get better. If you get one of them killed, however, he will remain dead for the rest of the game. The game is over when you have no pilots left. There are basically two kinds of missions: dogfight, and bomber. Sometimes, it is a combination of both. By the end, you get to go up against the bloody Red Baron. Wings II: Aces High is a great challenge, so good luck!

Directions:

Complete all the missions to earn badges and turn the tide of the war. 

Controls:

A Button - Accelerate
B Button - Slow Down
X Button - None
Y Button - Fire

Winter Olympics (Lillehammer 94 is added informally and is not part of the official title) is the official video game of the XVII Olympic Winter Games that were held in Lillehammer, Norway in 1994. Published by US Gold. Home computer versions (Amiga and PC) were developed by ID Software (not to be confused with id Software, of Doom fame) and console versions (GG, MD/Gen, Master System, Super NES) were developed by Tiertex. The game featured 10 winter sporting events. There are also major differences between platforms.

Players can represent different countries from Canada to England to Brazil. However, the player does not have the luxury of accented letters to make authentic looking French or Portuguese names. It is impossible for the player to name his character "Pel?" because there is no "?" symbol in the game, so players will have to call him "Pele" instead.

The player can train freely and compete in both full or mini (events selected by the player) Olympics. During competition, there are both medals and points tables. While in Olympic Gold points were awarded according to the medals table, in Winter Olympics they were given according to the best results, like decathlon. Doing so, it was perfectly possible to someone win the gold medal in short track, and get few more points than other skaters (even not finalists) that got better qualifying times. This scoring method also meant that someone who won gold medals in six or seven events might fall outside the top 10 if is disqualified on the remaining three.

Rock on! Wizardry is neat little first-person dungeon crawler that first appeared on the Apple ][. It has a very Dungeons & Dragons feel to it, which comes from the basic game play system, and the general "ambiance" of the game.

Anyway, the first three Wizardry Games (Proving Ground of the Mad Overlord, Knight of Diamonds, and Legacy of Llylgamyn) were all ported to the Nes, and were decent as far as Nes first-person games go ;).However, only "Proving grounds," and "Knight of Diamonds" were translated to English, leaving Legacy behind.

Not terribly long ago, these three games were given a bit of a makeover (read: graphics), and re-released for the Snes. The nifty thing is that it was released with both English and Japanese script, with an option to choose which language you'd like.

However, this didn't translate everything, so Gideon picked it up and remedied the situation. He fixed various menus, spell descriptions, and (most importantly) added a lowercase font. In order to set the game to English you *MUST* open the option menu on the screen that appears after you choose which of the three games you're playing, and set all the language options to 'English.' Simple, eh?

Anyway, this games comes highly recommended. You should check it out.

The plot revolves around biotechnology researcher Kal Morrow and his son Saul. When the former is kidnapped by the evil Chimera organization, Saul uses one of his father's inventions to turn himself into a wolf-human hybrid (similar to a werewolf) that may be capable of defeating Chimera.

Wolfchild was designed by Simon Phipps, also responsible for the earlier Switchblade 2, a rather similar game. The action is viewed from the side and scrolls in eight directions. The player must guide Saul through five levels, negotiating platforms and shooting various monsters, the result of Chimera experiments. Initially, the player character is Saul in his normal, human form. Only when enough energy has been collected does he turn into a wolf-human, giving him much better attack techniques.

Wolverine seeks information about his past and uncovers a huge tangled mess in the present. So he sets out to untangle it by clawing everything in sight to pieces. And by calling everyone "Bub."

The graphics in Wolverine Adamantium Rage are truly outstanding. The detailed backgrounds make every scene worth looking at (but don't admire them for too long), and Wolverine and the plethora of villains are very well drawn and animated. The cut scenes could be right out of the comics. The sounds are just as good, great music and cool effects (lots of yummy clawing noises).

Directions:

Wolverine Adamantium Rage is a great game for comic fans. It's one of the few to actually take a comic book super hero and make decent use of his super powers. Now anybody can make a game where you go around with big claws on your hand and rip stuff apart, but Wolverine has another special talent, i.e. his regenerative power. His Adamantium skeleton makes him almost indestructible to crushing blows, and his healing will get him through any laceration, punctures or internal damage that might happen to get through, as long as he has time.

Well, you guessed it, the game gives him his fast healing but makes sure he doesn't always have time to use it. It seems that Wolverine is being chased by a suicide bombing little girl who will reduce him to pulp if she ever catches up, so you have plenty of incentive to keep moving!

As I mentioned there are tons of bad guys trying to stand in Wolverine's way, and lots of cool boss fights. There's nothing better than having new enemies to confront around every corner, especially when they're not just different pictures, but really different characters with different attack patterns and behaviors.

And of course, as resourceful as our Wolverine is, he has a widely varied arsenal of ways to kick the stuffing out of all those comic creeps, while avoiding the same fate for himself. Here are some advanced techniques using various key combinations: Press Up to execute a dive roll. This can be done from the floor or in the middle of a jump. Press Down and B to make a Super Jump. From here you can do a Super Claw by pressing L or press Up and X to grab the ceiling with your claws, where you can climb back and forth or just hang out a while. Press Down and L for a crouching claw. Hold Down and X to dig down through certain floors, or Down and A to perform a Claw Uppercut. Press Down then A and X to spring up with claws extended to both sides, while your enemies run up and impale themselves! 

The only difficulty with all these moves, and really my only problem with the whole game, is that they are so complicated and hard to remember, much less execute on a tight schedule, especially since so many of the buttons do different things depending on whether you are standing, ducking, jumping, etc.

Overall, Wolverine Adamantium Rage is a really fun game, even has good replay value with password access to whichever level you want to run through. You can try to use all those different attack forms to abuse the bad guys in new and exciting ways. 

Controls:

A Button - Punch
B Button - Jump
X Button - Claw, Latch on to Wall
Y Button - Kick
L Button - Backhand
R Button - Claw Flurry
Up - Dive
Down - Duck
Start Button - Start, Pause

Hints:

Passwords

Use these codes to skip through the first few areas. If you don't know the characters, though, it will take a little while to figure them out!

Level 1: Destroyer, Storm, Psylocke, Storm
Level 2: Psylocke, Cyclops, Storm, Destroyer
Level 3: Professor X, Iceman, Psylocke, Psylocke

This is a really cool game from Enix, evil programmers extraordinaire. You are the human controller for a robot whose creator was kidnapped. Your commands, issued via an interface unit that looks rather like a fairy, are carried out by the robot. If he feels like it. Your other job is to condition him into doing the actions you want him to. FOr instance, if he walks over to a book and throws it like a baseball, you gotta slap him upside his head. If he reads it, you have to praise him. Simple enough, huh? Wrong. If he gets scolded too many times, he'll stop listening to you. Period. And except for when the robot misbehaves too many times in a row, this is a damn fun game. And hey, if you didn't catch it before, it's Enix. You're obliged to play it. So stop reading and make with the playing.

The object of the game is to build words of three letters or more using the tiles that fall from the top of the playing area. Words can be constructed horizontally or vertically, and multiple words can overlap each other. If the player manages to construct the magic word at the top of the screen, the well will be cleared of all tiles and the player will receive a large bonus.

Occasionally, a free tile (denoted by a "?") will drop. Its letter can be selected by the player (either by typing it in the PC version, or scrolling through letters with a button on the console versions). If the player does not choose a letter, the block will become a random letter when it stops. Eraser blocks will fall and remove whatever letter that they land on (in the SNES version, the eraser is replaced with bombs and vials of acid).

In the Super Nintendo version, players advance from levels "A" to "J." There is no level after "J."

The game plays like many other fighting games, but instead of a 6-button layout, the original World Heroes uses only 3 of the standard 4 Neo-Geo buttons: one for punching, another for kicking, and the last for throwing. The former two buttons can be held down longer in order to deliver stronger attacks, similar to the first Street Fighter control scheme, with only two levels of strength and using standard buttons instead of pneumatic buttons. In the SNES version (and later games, starting with World Heroes 2 Jet), it is possible to assign the 4 basic attacks to different buttons. In World Heroes Perfect, each character had a traditional four-button attack layout, but could also achieve stronger attacks by pushing down two respective punch or kick buttons at the same time.

In World Heroes Perfect, every character has an ABC Special Move that can be activated by pressing the A, B, and C buttons at the same time. Moves vary by character, though they all require strategic use and are easy to activate, allowing for more tactical battles. For example, the character Fuuma's ABC Special allows him to fake a special move; J. Max's ABC Special allows him to catch, hold onto, and throw back projectiles; and Kim Dragon's ABC Special allows him to perform counters while blocking.

Aside from the normal tournament mode, there is also a popular Deathmatch mode (which was removed in World Heroes 2 Jet and World Heroes Perfect). In it, the arenas are filled with different kinds of traps that can change conditions in the bouts or even damage the characters (such as spikes, bombs, greasy or sticky floors, etc.). Deathmatch mode may have been inspired by the growing popularity of deathmatch style professional wrestling in Japan at the time, mostly made famous by Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.

The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. However, the standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.

Worms is a turn based artillery game, similar to other early games in the genre such as Scorched Earth. The game is set on a two-dimensional field. The players control a team of worms, each consisting of four members. The objective is to kill every member of the opposing team(s) within a set time limit per round. Each turn, which lasts from 45 to 100 seconds, a player may move a selected worm and use one or more of the available weapons and tools.

The weapons include simple firearms like the shotgun and uzi, alongside a variety of heavy weapons such as the bazooka (the default selection), cluster grenades and airstrikes. The game also includes a number of 'secret' weapons (available through cheat codes on options screens or 'weapon drops' during the game) such as the Banana Bomb and exploding sheep, for which the series has become famous.

Also available are various tools such as the 'drill', 'blowtorch' and 'girders' - often used to add protection, adding additional strategy elements. The 'ninja rope', 'bungee' and 'teleport' are also available for greater movement across the playing field.

Raw is one of the most successful TV wrestling programs in the world today. Those athletes go out and give it their all to entertain millions. In the old days, RAW had many greats like Bret Hart, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Diesel and Bam Bam Bigelow! In this game, you play as them to win!

Directions:

There are many ways to have fun with this game. There's the occasional one-on-one match, where two wrestlers go at it. There's also tag team matches, where two teams of 2 fight against each other. There's a Survivor Series, where two teams of 4 fight and if one member is defeated, he is eliminated. If they all are eliminated on a team, the remaining team wins! Royal Rumble is where wrestlers come in randomly and your job is to get them out of the ring before they do it to you. In the Bedlam match, all 4 tag team competitors are in the ring together and they do not need to be tagged in. Lastly, the Raw Endurance Match, where two teams of 6 will compete. Each team will send out one wrestler at a time to combat a wrestler from the other team. The last team that still has a member who hasn't been pinned wins the match-up.

For one-on-one, tag team, and Bedlam matches, you have sub-options! There's a one fall match, where the first person to pin their opponent wins. There's a brawl, where you can fight anywhere around ringside, and anything goes! And there's the Tournament, where you fight in a series of matches for the WWF Championships!

The list of wrestlers are: Bret Hart, Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, Razor Ramon, Lex Luger, Doink, Shawn Michaels, 1-2-3 Kid, Diesel, Owen Hart, and Luna Vachon.

In a One-on-One match, two wrestlers (one player versus the computer or two players) square off for a face-to-face bout. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament variations are available. One Fall matches feature an in-ring referee and are contested under standard rules. Victory is achieved by a 3-count pinfall or a count-out if a wrestler stays outside of the ring for a full 10 count. In a Brawl, however, the referee is absent. This allows unlimited time outside the ring and illegal moves such as eye raking and choking are allowed at all times. The Brawl match doesn't require a pinfall to win; instead, the first player to be entirely drained of their stamina submits in defeat. In a Tournament, a player must battle through the entire roster in a series of One Fall matches to win the championship belt.

A Tag Team match is made up of two teams of two wrestlers (if two players are involved, they can choose to either control opposite teams or be on the same team against the computer). Whenever one wrestler gets tired, they can tag in their partner. A wrestler on the apron can grab an opponent if they get close to the ropes, allowing their partner to attack them. One Fall, Brawl, and Tournament configurations are available. The same rules for the singles One Fall and Brawl matches apply to tag team matches. In the tag team Tournament mode, either one player or two cooperative players will choose two wrestlers to form a team and then must defeat the remaining wrestlers in a series of One Fall tag team matches to win the tag team championship.

A Triple Tag Team match is similar to a Tag Team match, except instead of two wrestlers to a team, there are three wrestlers on each team. Only one partner for each team appears on the apron at a time. The player can switch outside partners by pressing a button. One Fall and Brawl options are available (with one player or two players head-to-head), with the same rules as singles and tag team matches.

The Royal Rumble begins with two wrestlers, and more adversaries enter until six wrestlers are in the ring. Additional wrestlers enter as others are eliminated. There are no holds barred, and elimination occurs when a wrestler is thrown out of the ring. A wrestler must be worn down before they can be thrown out, unless they're caught running with a hip toss. The last wrestler remaining in the ring after all twelve have entered wins the match. At the end of a Royal Rumble, score rankings are shown giving a wrestler's total time in the ring along with a list of opponents they eliminated.

The object here is simple: defeat your opponent(s). In order to do so, you must weaken your enemy with suplexes, body slams, and other moves. There are three game modes: One-On-One, where you and one opponent duke it out, Tag Team, where two teams of two fight off against each other, and Survivor Series, where it's 4-on-4. If someone gets pinned, they are eliminated. After all the people on one team are eliminated, the other team wins. There are 10 wrestlers to choose from: "Macho Man" Randy Savage, Jake "The Snake" Roberts, The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, Hawk, Earthquake, Animal, Typhoon, Ted DiBiase and Sid Justice.

The game takes place in the near-anarchic future of the year 2097, in which the world's economy has been devastated, governments have collapsed, and organized crime has gained dramatic influence.

X-Kaliber 2097's American soundtrack was arranged by 90s electronic/industrial music group Psykosonik. Psykosonik's soundtrack became an unusually large part of the game's marketing, and was often plugged in marketing blurbs. The soundtrack is also mentioned on the game packaging, and has its own section in the game manual.

In X-Kaliber 2097, the player guides a swordsman named Slash through a side-scrolling environment. Boss encounters take place as one-on-one matches in the style of versus fighting games.

Crisis on Genosha!

Forgive me on bringing you here on such short notice X-Men, but the situation in Genosha is far worse than I once feared. As you know, I have been troubled by the rise in anti-mutant activity on the tiny island nation.

While using Cerebro to scan the island for the source of the anti-mutant corruption, I came upon the presence of one of our oldest and deadliest enemies. It appears Apocalypse has found a home in Genosha.

It is now clear that the Genoshan government is using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. But, Apocalypse must have his own plans for the mutants of Genosha. Whatever they may be, they will only become worse unless you put a stop to this madness.

Our invasion of Genosha begins tonight.....

_________________________

The Alpha 1 Solar System, threatened by invaders from the artificial world NGC-1611, has gathered together the systems best defenses in an effort to repel the invasion. Three pilots and their machines are dispatched, charged with the task of destroying the invader's power source and, if possible, locate the legendary weapon Xardion in the process.

Gameplay:

While possessing the typical qualities of action platformers at the time it was made (jump, duck, shoot etc.), Xardion made use of a few novel elements. Additionally, the game had a role-playing element where experience points could be accrued by defeating enemies and bosses, and each level up increased the player's maximum life and special ability points.

During the game, the player takes control of one of three available robot forms. Each form represents one of the three inhabited worlds in the system: Alcedes, from the Fire Planet; Triton, from the Water Planet, and Panthera, from the Desert Planet.

Each form has its own particular abilities and weaknesses. For example, Panthera is less than half the height of the others, and as such can enter narrow passages to collect items. Additionally, each form possesses its own health and special ability points, and must be upgraded separately from the others. This is equivalent to a 'tag-team' game mechanic, where one heavily-damaged character can be swapped instantly for another.

Eventually, one of the robot forms is replaced by Xardion, which combines the abilities of all three previous forms and exceeds them. Xardion only becomes available near the end of the game, but joins the team at level one. An obstruction that can only be cleared by a sufficiently leveled Xardion forces the player to return to earlier levels in order to gain levels and develop special abilities.

Do you love cookies? Then try Yoshi's Cookie! This fast-paced puzzle game is fun for kids of all ages. It's easy... just move the randomly placed cookies (HEART, FLOWER, DIAMOND, CHECK, CIRCLE AND YOSHI) into rows and columns of the same type. If you make a row or column of the same cookies, the line disappears and you score points. remove more than one row or column at a time for really big points!

--From the SNES Yoshi's Cookie instruction manual.

Overview:

This is probably the best looking of the Yoshi's Cookie games. The colors are much brighter than NES and it's easier on the eyes. Mario and Yoshi work together in this one to get the cookies lined up and packaged. There is a bit of simple animation as the cookies slide around on the screen and Yoshi and Mario pull their levers, but it's mostly a very simple looking game. If you are drawn to play this game it will be because you love puzzles and not because you care about dazzling animation or effects. Still, the backgrounds do change, providing you with a bit more visual stimulation than other Yoshi's Cookie games.

The music is cute and just what you would expect from a game like this. You even get to decide which music you prefer in the action option, which really increases the odds that you will be able to find something that you can at least tolerate.

Directions:

ACTION:

Lock on to a cookie then press a direction to change the order of the cookies. Move the cookies around to get all of the same kind of cookie in one row. Only two cookies are necessary to be a row, but no matter how long the row is, all of the cookies must be the same in it for the row to be eliminated.

Sometimes you can do this in one move! If the cookies reach the edge of the screen, it's game over. Manipulate them as fast as you can to keep that from happening. While you are trying to clear the cookies you started with, more cookies will begin creeping in from the sides. When they touch each other they will then be permanently (until you eliminate them) on the screen. However, if you eliminate the cookies already there while the new ones are still creeping up, you win and the new ones disappear and don't count at all. Any cookies approaching when you eliminate some cookies but not all of them will retreat and give you a bit of a break. Also, any approaching that match with those currently being eliminated will vanish as well. Speed up the movement of the cookies by pressing B if you don't have anything that matches.

Fill all the bars to the left of the screen next to any cookie and you will get a special Yoshi cookie that is basically a wild card... er, cookie. It will help eliminate any cookies you don't have a match for. 

VS:

In this part of the game you can choose to play against either the computer or a friend. You will have a fuse connected to your cookie box that is slowly burning down. If it burns all the way down your cookies will burn up and you will lose. Clearing cookies will gain you more fuse and time. New cookies will enter as you eliminate cookies, keeping your board full at all times. Clearing cookies also gains you points. The first player to 25 points wins. There will be different things written in the box below your character. This tells you what will happen when you complete a row of Yoshi cookies. Don't assume that everything that will happen is good for you though! Watch the X and O in the character box. When there is an X it will be bad for you (or good for your opponent) and when there is an O it will be good for you (or bad for your opponent). Be the first to win three games and you win!

By the way, the different levels of ATK (Attack), DEF (Defense), MES (Message), LMT (Limit) will affect how easy that character is to play as or play against. More: Attack power= longer attacks (the things the messages say), Defense= shorter time of attacks that have been performed against you, Message= faster message changing, and Limit= slower burning fuse (or more time).

PUZZLE:

In the puzzle option, you only have a limited number of moves to clear all of the cookies from the screen. Eliminate the cookies in the same fashion as you get rid of them in the Action game. Where it was 'possible' to clear them all in one move in the Action game, it will be required of you sometimes in the Puzzle game. New pieces do not enter the board in this game. 

Controls:

A Button - Hold to Lock On to Cookies
B Button - Makes Cookies Move Onto Screen Faster
L Button - Takes You Back One Move (Puzzle Game Only)
R Button - Takes You Back to the Start of That Stage (Puzzle Game Only)
Start Button - Pause
Select Button - Change Menu Selections

Mario and Yoshi have to save King Fret and his son Prince Pine of Jewellery Land from King Bowser and his Koopalings. Unlike most Mario games, it is a rail shooter, with support for the Super Scope light gun.

The game is played from the perspective of Mario, riding on Yoshi's back. Yoshi's head is always visible, and accidentally shooting at him causes a loss of health. The Super Scope can be fired automatically, which quickly drains power. The RPM of the Super Scope would decrease when its Power Meter was close to empty. When completely empty, it will continue firing but only one shot at a time if the Fire Button was still held down, signifying that the player needs to release the fire button and let it recharge. There are two fire flowers in the game and Collecting them increased the amount of time that the scope could shoot before needing to recharge.

Yoshi's Safari puts emphasis on platforming, and at times is imperative to jump (via the Cursor button) in order to avoid some obstacles. Also, there are branching paths that leads to different enemies, mini-bosses or prizes, though they always end in a same main road, which leads to a boss. The bosses can be the Koopalings with some of them piloting Mechs, bigger versions of normal enemies (such as a big Magikoopa or the Big Boo) to Bowser himself, wearing a suit of armor equipped with two Gun-Hands and a devastating energy cannon located in the stomach.

At the end of the game, a code for a harder game is given to use at the title screen. This not only changes the colors of the levels, but it also makes the bosses harder and changes the text of the story scenes to say that the events of the story are repeating themselves.

The main character, Adol, returns from adventuring with his friend Dogi to find his home town in trouble. Thus begins his side-scrolling RPG adventure, which will take him all over the world, again. To save the people from a creature of overwhelming evil bent on taking over the world, again.

Basically it's your normal side-scrolling type game with RPG features added in. A bit of an odd combination to me but it works out well in this case.

Graphically this game was right on, the characters and monsters are well done, animation is smooth, the scenery and backgrounds are great. The music isn't my favorite but you might like it. ;-)

Directions:

The Y's series is one of the classics, and if you play this game you'll know why. It has a great combination of storytelling and action, the perfect mix for many RPG gamers. 

The user interface for equipment was a bit counter-intuitive to me, but it's not difficult when you get used to it.

Be sure to buy equipment and equip it on the menu before leaving town. Press Select, choose Equipment, then select each type of equipment by pressing up or down, and equip the item by highlighting it. However, don't equip a ring as soon as you find it, because rings are always on and it drains their power.

You can duck and crawl to get through tight spaces, as well as swing your sword while crouching to attack low enemies. You can also swing your sword straight up or while jumping. Press Up to open doors and boxes, some need keys though. Press diagonally to go up or down stairs. 

Controls:  

A Button - Use Item
B Button - Jump, Confirm option
Y Button - Attack, Talk, Cancel option
Start Button - Start or Pause
Select Button - Open Menu

Hints:

Invincibility

At the logo screen, (American Sammy), wait until the logo fades in completely, then on Controller 2, press Up, Down, Up, Down, Select, Start. Then start the game and go to the Status menu. Press Select on Controller 2 to bring up DEBUG next to STATUS. Now you won't die, whenever your life drops to zero it immediately goes back up to full.

If you've played Ys 1 or Ys 2 (probably more 2), you'll be right at home! It plays pretty similarly to those games, you know.. Run into an enemy head-on and die, that kind of thing. It's basically the same game, except the graphics are just a tiny bit nicer looking. Which is to be expected, you know, for an early SNES title in part of an ongoing NES series. Just look at DQ5 and FF4, you know? Thankfully the game still rocks ass, so you'll have a good time with it.

4 Feb 07 - Gideon means business with this 2.0 release. A completely rewritten script, new and improved font, and it now works on copiers. It's complete, it's polished, and it works. What more can you ask for? If you haven't given this a try yet, what are you waiting for?

Zombies Ate My Neighbors
Platform: Super NES
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Gamepad
Genre: Shoot 'em Up , Run 'n Gun
Release Year: 1993
Developer: LucasArts
Publisher: Konami

The player chooses between two teenage characters, Zeke and Julie, or both in two-player mode. They navigate suburban neighborhoods, shopping malls, pyramids, and other areas, destroying a variety of horror-movie monsters, including vampires, werewolves, huge demonic babies, and the game's flagship, zombies. In each of the 48 stages (excluding the bonus levels, of which there are 6) the goal is to rescue the surviving neighbors, at which point a magical door opens that will take the player to the next stage. However, if the player is not careful, any enemy in the game will kill the neighbors, preventing them from being saved. At least one neighbor must be saved from each level to progress to the next. The game is lost if all of the neighbors in a certain stage are killed or if the player(s) lose all of their lives. Scoring points earns players more neighbors to save (but only up to the maximum of 10) and extra lives. 

Each level has a maximum of ten neighbors each neighbor type is worth a certain amount of points.

The monsters in the game are based on horror movies made in the 1950s as well as more modern movies such as Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (for example, the man with the chainsaw is based on Jason and Leatherface of those movies respectively). The weapons usefulness is also based on these depictions, such that werewolves die in one attack if attacked with silverware, or vampires die faster if attacked with the crucifix. The crucifix is the most powerful weapon and Pandora's Box is the most powerful special item.

In the SNES version of the game, there is a flamethrower which is not included in the Sega Mega Drive version. The flamethrower can only be found once in the game, in level 22, Revenge of Dr Tongue.

There is an extra level in which the character is permitted to walk around Lucas Arts and talk to the staff responsible for the game.

Censorship:

Due to the theme of the game, it was subject to some censorship. This game was released before the ESRB came along and before then, Nintendo did not want anything violent in their video games such as blood and gore. Nintendo of America itself ordered all depictions of red blood and gore be removed or changed to green ooze.

Censorship committees at several European Nations, i.e. United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, went a step further and had the game renamed to just 'Zombies' and ordered other changes, including making the chainsaw-wielding lunatics replaced with lumberjacks with axes.

Zool is a pretty fun game. It's kinda weird though. The game seems to be set in Candyland or something. Zool is like a lot of other side-scroller platforms. The use of colors and the graphics are great though. Zool is the name of your character that is a ninja. He's got a lot of cool moves. He can jump pretty high, and he can climb up the walls. He also has a gun, which kinda goes against the ninja way, but it's got unlimited ammo. If you like side scrolling platformers, give Zool a try.

Directions:

Help Zool the ninja get throught the levels by shooting and jumping on his enemies. 

Controls:  

A Button - Jump
B Button - Shoot
X Button - None
Y Button - None
L Button - None
R Button - None
Start Button - Start/Pause
Select Button - Select

Hints:

Don't Go Too Fast

If you go to fast, you'll run right into enemies, for some reason, it's hard to see the enemies on this game untill you get right up on them.

Genre: Puzzle
Release Year: 1995

The player controls a triangle in the center of the screen. Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward. Two consecutive pieces will never come in from the same quadrant, and runs of consecutive identical pieces on one row are longer than one might think statistically.

If a piece falls into the center square, the game is over.

If the player shoots a piece of the same color as their triangle, it will be "zooped" (cleared) and points are earned. If the piece behind the target piece is also of the same color, it is also "zooped." The same goes for the next piece, and so on. In the example Image:Zoop genesis.jpg, shooting to the left of the position in the screenshot will "zoop" the green pieces and return the player to the center, facing right (the opposite direction).

If a piece of a different color than the player's current piece is shot, the player's piece will switch colors with it. This is also what happens when a piece of a different color is encountered after zooping one or more pieces of the same color. In the example, shooting down would bounce off the orange piece (leaving a green piece behind), and return with the orange piece.

When the quota of "zooped" pieces is met, the game speeds up and (before level 10) the background changes.
